Loeb, Louis Moore Bacon and Steven A. Cohen have much in common. They have managed billions of dollars in capital, earning vast fortunes. They have invested large sums in art and millions more in political candidates.Moreover, each has exploited an esoteric tax loophole that saved them millions in taxes. The trick? Route the money to Bermuda and back.With inequality at its highest levels in nearly a century and public debate rising over whether the government should respond to it through higher taxes on the wealthy, the very richest Americans have financed a sophisticated and astonishingly effective apparatus for shielding their fortunes. Some call it the income defense industry, consisting of a high-priced phalanx of lawyers, estate planners, lobbyists and anti-tax activists who exploit and defend a dizzying array of tax maneuvers, virtually none of them available to taxpayers of more modest means.In recent years, this apparatus has become one of the most powerful avenues of influence for wealthy Americans of all political stripes, including Mr. Loeb and Mr. Cohen, who give heavily to Republicans, and the liberal billionaire George Soros, who has called for higher levies on the rich while at the same time using tax loopholes to bolster his own fortune.All are among a small group providing much of the early cash for the 2016 presidential campaign.Operating largely out of public view in tax court, through arcane legislative provisions and in private negotiations with the Internal Revenue Service the wealthy have used their influence to steadily whittle away at the governments ability to tax them. The effect has been to create a kind of private tax system, catering to only several thousand Americans.The impact on their own fortunes has been stark. Two decades ago, when Bill Clinton was elected president, the 400 highest-earning taxpayers in America paid nearly 27 percent of their income in federal taxes, according to I.R.S. data. By 2012, when President Obama was re-elected, that figure had fallen to less than 17 percent, which is just slightly more than the typical family making $100,000 annually, when payroll taxes are included for both groups.The ultra-wealthy literally pay millions of dollars for these services, said Jeffrey A. Winters, a political scientist at Northwestern University who studies economic elites, and save in the tens or hundreds of millions in taxes.Some of the biggest current tax battles are being waged by some of the most generous supporters of 2016 candidates. They include the families of the hedge fund investors Robert Mercer, who gives to Republicans, and James Simons, who gives to Democrats; as well as the options trader Jeffrey Yass, a libertarian-leaning donor to Republicans.Mr. Yasss firm is litigating what the agency deemed to be tens of millions of dollars in underpaid taxes. Renaissance Technologies, the hedge fund Mr. Simons founded and which Mr. Mercer helps run, is currently under review by the I.R.S. over a loophole that saved their fund an estimated $6.8 billion in taxes over roughly a decade, according to a Senate investigation. Some of these same families have also contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to conservative groups that have attacked virtually any effort to raises taxes on the wealthy.In the heat of the presidential race, the influence of wealthy donors is being tested. At stake is the Obama administrations 2013 tax increase on high earners the first substantial increase in two decades and an I.R.S. initiative to ensure that, in effect, the higher rates stick by cracking down on tax avoidance by the wealthy.While Democrats like Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton have pledged to raise taxes on these voters, virtually every Republican has advanced policies that would vastly reduce their tax bills, sometimes to as little as 10 percent of their income.At the same time, most Republican candidates favor eliminating the inheritance tax, a move that would allow the new rich, and the old, to bequeath their fortunes intact, solidifying the wealth gap far into the future. And several have proposed a substantial reduction or even elimination in the already deeply discounted tax rates on investment gains, a foundation of the most lucrative tax strategies.Theres this notion that the wealthy use their money to buy politicians; more accurately, its that they can buy policy, and specifically, tax policy, said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities who served as chief economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Thats why these egregious loopholes exist, and why its so hard to close them.The Family OfficeEach of the top 400 earners took home, on average, about $336 million in 2012, the latest year for which data is available. If the bulk of that money had been paid out as salary or wages, as it is for the typical American, the tax obligations of those wealthy taxpayers could have more than doubled.Instead, much of their income came from convoluted partnerships and high-end investment funds. Other earnings accrued in opaque family trusts and foreign shell corporations, beyond the reach of the tax authorities.The well-paid technicians who devise these arrangements toil away at white-shoe law firms and elite investment banks, as well as a variety of obscure boutiques. But at the fulcrum of the strategizing over how to minimize taxes are so-called family offices, the customized wealth management departments of Americans with hundreds of millions or billions of dollars in assets.Family offices have existed since the late 19th century, when the Rockefellers pioneered the institution, and gained popularity in the 1980s. But they have proliferated rapidly over the last decade, as the ranks of the super-rich, and the size of their fortunes, swelled to record proportions.We have so much wealth being created, significant wealth, that it creates a need for the family office structure now, said Sree Arimilli, an industry recruiting consultant.Family offices, many of which are dedicated to managing and protecting the wealth of a single family, oversee everything from investment strategy to philanthropy. But tax planning is a core function. While the specific techniques these advisers employ to minimize taxes can be mind-numbingly complex, they generally follow a few simple principles, like converting one type of income into another type thats taxed at a lower rate.Mr. Loeb, for example, has invested in a Bermuda-based reinsurer an insurer to insurance companies that turns around and invests the money in his hedge fund. That maneuver transforms his profits from short-term bets in the market, which the government taxes at roughly 40 percent, into long-term profits, known as capital gains, which are taxed at roughly half that rate. It has had the added advantage of letting Mr. Loeb defer taxes on this income indefinitely, allowing his wealth to compound and grow more quickly.The Bermuda insurer Mr. Loeb helped set up went public in 2013 and is active in the insurance business, not merely a tax dodge. Mr. Cohen and Mr. Bacon abandoned similar insurance-based strategies in recent years. Our investment in Max Re was not a tax-driven scheme, but rather a sound investment response to investor interest in a more dynamically managed portfolio akin to Warren Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway, said Mr. Bacon, who leads Moore Capital Management. Hedge funds were a minority of the investment portfolio, and Moore Capitals products a much smaller subset of this alternative portfolio. Mr. Loeb and Mr. Cohen declined to comment.ImageCredit...Left: Amanda Gordon/Bloomberg News, via Getty ImagesOrganizing ones business as a partnership can be lucrative in its own right. Some of the partnerships from which the wealthy derive their income are allowed to sell shares to the public, making it easy to cash out a chunk of the business while retaining control. But unlike publicly traded corporations, they pay no corporate income tax; the partners pay taxes as individuals. And the income taxes are often reduced by large deductions, such as for depreciation.For large private partnerships, meanwhile, the I.R.S. often struggles to determine whether a tax shelter exists, an abusive tax transaction is being used, according to a recent report by the Government Accountability Office. The agency is not allowed to collect underpaid taxes directly from these partnerships, even those with several hundred partners. Instead, it must collect from each individual partner, requiring the agency to commit significant time and manpower.The wealthy can also avail themselves of a range of esoteric and customized tax deductions that go far beyond writing off a home office or dinner with a client. One aggressive strategy is to place income in a type of charitable trust, generating a deduction that offsets the income tax. The trust then purchases whats known as a private placement life insurance policy, which invests the money on a tax-free basis, frequently in a number of hedge funds. The persons heirs can inherit, also tax-free, whatever money is left after the trust pays out a percentage each year to charity, often a considerable sum.Many of these maneuvers are well established, and wealthy taxpayers say they are well within their rights to exploit them. Others exist in a legal gray area, its boundaries defined by the willingness of taxpayers to defend their strategies against the I.R.S. Almost all are outside the price range of the average taxpayer.Among tax lawyers and accountants, the best and brightest get a high from figuring out how to do tricky little deals, said Karen L. Hawkins, who until recently headed the I.R.S. office that oversees tax practitioners. Frankly, it is almost beyond the intellectual and resource capacity of the Internal Revenue Service to catch.The combination of cost and complexity has had a profound effect, tax experts said. Whatever tax rates Congress sets, the actual rates paid by the ultra-wealthy tend to fall over time as they exploit their numerous advantages.From Mr. Obamas inauguration through the end of 2012, federal income tax rates on individuals did not change (excluding payroll taxes). But the highest-earning one-thousandth of Americans went from paying an average of 20.9 percent to 17.6 percent. By contrast, the top 1 percent, excluding the very wealthy, went from paying just under 24 percent on average to just over that level.We do have two different tax systems, one for normal wage-earners and another for those who can afford sophisticated tax advice, said Victor Fleischer, a law professor at the University of San Diego who studies the intersection of tax policy and inequality. At the very top of the income distribution, the effective rate of tax goes down, contrary to the principles of a progressive income tax system.A Very Quiet DefenseHaving helped foster an alternative tax system, wealthy Americans have been aggressive in defending it.Trade groups representing the Bermuda-based insurance company Mr. Loeb helped set up, for example, have spent the last several months pleading with the I.R.S. that its proposed rules tightening the hedge fund insurance loophole are too onerous.The major industry group representing private equity funds spends hundreds of thousands of dollars each year lobbying on such issues as carried interest, the granddaddy of Wall Street tax loopholes, which makes it possible for fund managers to pay the capital gains rate rather than the higher standard tax rate on a substantial share of their income for running the fund.The budget deal that Congress approved in October allows the I.R.S. to collect underpaid taxes from large partnerships at the firm level for the first time which is far easier for the agency thanks to a provision that lawmakers slipped into the deal at the last minute, before many lobbyists could mobilize. But the new rules are relatively weak firms can still choose to have partners pay the taxes and dont take effect until 2018, giving the wealthy plenty of time to weaken them further.Shortly after the provision passed, the Managed Funds Association, an industry group that represents prominent hedge funds like D. E. Shaw, Renaissance Technologies, Tiger Management and Third Point, began meeting with members of Congress to discuss a wish list of adjustments. The founders of these funds have all donated at least $500,000 to 2016 presidential candidates. During the Obama presidency, the association itself has risen to become one of the most powerful trade groups in Washington, spending over $4 million a year on lobbying.And while the lobbying clout of the wealthy is most often deployed through industry trade associations and lawyers, some rich families have locked arms to advance their interests more directly.The inheritance tax has been a primary target. In the early 1990s, a California family office executive named Patricia Soldano began lobbying on behalf of wealthy families to repeal the tax, which would not only save them money, but also make it easier to preserve their business empires from one generation to the next. The idea struck many hardened operatives as unrealistic at the time, given that the tax affected only the wealthiest Americans. But Ms. Soldanos efforts funded in part by the Mars and Koch families laid the groundwork for a one-year elimination in 2010.The tax has been restored, but currently applies only to couples leaving roughly $11 million or more to their heirs, up from those leaving more than $1.2 million when Ms. Soldano started her campaign. It affected fewer than 5,200 families last year.If anyone would have told me wed be where we are today, I would never have guessed it, Ms. Soldano said in an interview.Some of the most profound victories are barely known outside the insular world of the wealthy and their financial managers.In 2009, Congress set out to require that investment partnerships like hedge funds register with the Securities and Exchange Commission, partly so that regulators would have a better grasp on the risks they posed to the financial system.The early legislative language would have required single-family offices to register as well, exposing the highly secretive institutions to scrutiny that their clients were eager to avoid. Some of the I.R.S.s cases against the wealthy originate with tips from the S.E.C., which is often better positioned to spot tax evasion.By the summer of 2009, several family office executives had formed a lobbying group called the Private Investor Coalition to push back against the proposal. The coalition won an exemption in the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform bill, then spent much of the next year persuading the S.E.C. to largely adopt its preferred definition of family office.So expansive was the resulting loophole that Mr. Soross $24.5 billion hedge fund took advantage of it, converting to a family office after returning capital to its remaining outside investors. The hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller, a former business partner of Mr. Soros, took the same step.The Soros family, which generally supports Democrats, has committed at least $1 million to the 2016 presidential campaign; Mr. Druckenmiller, who favors Republicans, has put slightly more than $300,000 behind three different G.O.P. presidential candidates.A slide presentation from the Private Investor Coalitions 2013 annual meeting credited the success to multiple meetings with members of the Senate Banking Committee, the House Financial Services Committee, congressional staff and S.E.C. staff. All with a low profile, the document noted. We got most of what we wanted AND a few extras we didnt request.A Hobbled MonitorAfter all the loopholes and all the lobbying, what remains of the governments ability to collect taxes from the wealthy runs up against one final hurdle: the crisis facing the I.R.S.President Obama has made fighting tax evasion by the rich a priority. In 2010, he signed legislation making it easier to identify Americans who squirreled away assets in Swiss bank accounts and Cayman Islands shelters.His I.R.S. convened a Global High Wealth Industry Group, known colloquially as the wealth squad, to scrutinize the returns of Americans with incomes of at least $10 million a year.But while these measures have helped the government retrieve billions, the agencys efforts have flagged in the face of scandal, political pressure and budget cuts. Between 2010, the year before Republicans took control of the House of Representatives, and 2014, the I.R.S. budget dropped by almost $2 billion in real terms, or nearly 15 percent. That has forced it to shed about 5,000 high-level enforcement positions out of about 23,000, according to the agency.Audit rates for the $10 million-plus club spiked in the first few years of the Global High Wealth program, but have plummeted since then.ImageCredit...Left: Carly Erickson/BFA; Right: Doug Kuntz for The New York TimesThe political challenge for the agency became especially acute in 2013, after the agency acknowledged singling out conservative nonprofits in a review of political activity by tax-exempt groups. (Senior officials left the agency as a result of the controversy.)Several former I.R.S. officials, including Marcus Owens, who once headed the agencys Exempt Organizations division, said the controversy badly damaged the agencys willingness to investigate other taxpayers, even outside the exempt division.I.R.S. enforcement is either absent or diminished in certain areas, he said. Mr. Owens added that his former department which provides some oversight of money used by charities and nonprofits has been decimated.Groups like FreedomWorks and Americans for Tax Reform, which are financed partly by the foundations of wealthy families and large businesses, have called for impeaching the I.R.S. commissioner. They are bolstered by deep-pocketed advocacy groups like the Club for Growth, which has aided primary challenges against Republicans who have voted in favor of higher taxes.In 2014, the Club for Growth Action fund raised more than $9 million and spent much of it helping candidates critical of the I.R.S. Roughly 60 percent of the money raised by the fund came from just 12 donors, including Mr. Mercer, who has given the group $2 million in the last five years. Mr. Mercer and his immediate family have also donated more than $11 million to several super PACs supporting Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, an outspoken I.R.S. critic and a presidential candidate.Another prominent donor is Mr. Yass, who helps run a trading firm called the Susquehanna International Group. He donated $100,000 to the Club for Growth Action fund in September. Mr. Yass serves on the board of the libertarian Cato Institute and, like Mr. Mercer, appears to subscribe to limited-government views that partly motivate his political spending.But he may also have more than a passing interest in creating a political environment that undermines the I.R.S. Susquehanna is currently challenging a proposed I.R.S. determination that an affiliate of the firm effectively repatriated more than $375 million in income from subsidiaries located in Ireland and the Cayman Islands in 2007, creating a large tax liability. (The affiliate brought the money back to the United States in later years and paid dividend taxes on it; the I.R.S. asserts that it should have paid the ordinary income tax rate, at a cost of tens of millions of dollars more.)In June, Mr. Yass donated more than $2 million to three super PACs aligned with Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, who has called for taxing all income at a flat rate of 14.5 percent. That change in itself would save wealthy supporters like Mr. Yass millions of dollars.Mr. Paul, also a presidential candididate, has suggested going even further, calling the I.R.S. a rogue agency and circulating a petition in 2013 calling for the tax equivalent of regime change. Be it now therefore resolved, the petition reads, that we, the undersigned, demand the immediate abolishment of the Internal Revenue Service.But even if that campaign is a long shot, the richest taxpayers will continue to enjoy advantages over everyone else.For the ultra-wealthy, our tax code is like a leaky barrel, said J.

Mrs. Clinton said that while the decision of some nations to welcome migrants was admirable, it had opened the door to political turmoil, the rise of the right and Britains decision to withdraw from the European Union.I think Europe needs to get a handle on migration because that is what lit the flame, Mrs. Clinton said in the interview with The Guardian, which was conducted before the United States midterm elections this month.I admire the very generous and compassionate approaches that were taken particularly by leaders like Angela Merkel, but I think it is fair to say Europe has done its part, and must send a very clear message we are not going to be able to continue provide refuge and support because if we dont deal with the migration issue it will continue to roil the body politic, she said.The issue of migration has been a divisive one worldwide, and especially so in Europe, in the wake of an influx of refugees and migrants that, in 2015 alone, drew one million people to the continent. Since then, its leaders have cut unauthorized migration to Europe by 90 percent, largely through the kinds of deterrents Mrs. Clinton belatedly recommended.In the United States, President Trump has mobilized his base of supporters by focusing on what he calls the perils of immigration. He spoke frequently before the midterm elections about a caravan of immigrants traveling north toward the country's southern border. Democrats agreed on a strategy of mostly ignoring that issue, but the party is divided on how best to grapple with immigration in general.Mrs. Clinton's remarks to The Guardian drew criticism and a dose of surprise from an array of scholars, pro-immigration advocates and pundits on both the left and right, some of whom were so perplexed by the comments that they wondered aloud whether Mrs. Clinton had perhaps misspoken. Mrs. Clinton, many said, has a long history of supporting refugees a track record seemingly at odds with her recent remarks. Her immigration platform in the 2016 presidential election boasted that we embrace immigrants, not denigrate them.A spokesman for Mrs. Clinton did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment on Thursday night.I was kind of shocked, Eskinder Negash, the president and chief executive of the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, said of Mrs. Clintons comments. If shes simply saying you need to cut down on refugees coming to Europe to ask for asylum because they have a well-founded fear of persecution, just to appease some right-wing political leaders, its just not the right thing to do.Tanja Bueltmann, a history professor at Northumbria University in Britain who focuses on migration issues, said Mrs. Clintons perspective was tragically misjudged.Ultimately, immigration is not actually the problem that inflamed voters: Much more foundational issues, such as austerity, are the real reason, Professor Bueltmann said. Immigrants and refugees are simply the scapegoats populists have chosen to use to drive forward their ideas.Mrs. Clintons comments came against a complicated backdrop in Europe. Far-right parties have seized on the immigration issue and gained a foothold in parliaments and governments across the continent, while centrist leaders in a number of countries have undertaken largely successful efforts since 2016 to drastically lower the number of unauthorized immigrants now reaching their borders.Anti-immigration candidates have risen to power in Italy and Austria, and they have gained seats in countries like Germany. The open migration policies of Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany since 2005, ended up causing turmoil within her government and contributed to major electoral setbacks. She recently announced that she would step down as the leader of her conservative party in December and not seek re-election in 2021.To liberals in Europe, Mrs. Clintons advice may have seemed belated as the continent continues its conservative tilt; but it was right on time for the rising populists, who seized on her remarks as they seek to revive a fading and highly effective issue.Maybe Hillary has understood the lesson, said Giorgia Meloni, the leader of the far-right Brothers of Italy party, which has advocated an Italians First platform and a hard line against migrants entering their country.Ms. Meloni, who recently hosted Stephen K. Bannon President Trumps former chief strategist as a keynote speaker at her partys annual conference in Rome, added that Mrs. Clinton appeared to acknowledge that opposition to migration was not a problem of racism, and that if you dont control migration it will affect mostly poor people, people living on the outskirts, working classes.The left didnt understand that, or didnt want to, and they paid for their distance from the people, she said.At the same time, centrist leaders have worked to make the continent less hospitable to unauthorized migrants; the number of new arrivals there has dropped to a fraction of what it was.For instance, Ms. Merkel, the center-right German leader, and Frans Timmermanns, the center-left former Dutch foreign minister, led efforts to forge a counter-migration pact with Turkey in March 2016, promising the country billions of euros in aid for their help in stemming the migrant flow from Syria. Italy reached a similar deal with Libya. The deal was criticized by liberals, leftists and rights activists but afterward unauthorized migration to Europe plummeted by 90 percent.We must get the facts straight, said Gerald Knaus, the architect of the controversial deal with Turkey. Today in 2018, few irregular migrants reach the European Union.Mr. Knaus said that mimicking the approach of the far right only risked helping them. Just getting tough without any strategy does the work of the far right, he said.Democrats in the United States have also struggled to come up with a collective stance on immigration to counter President Trumps relentless focus on the issue.Indeed, Mrs. Clintons assessment represented a stark reminder of the sort of politics she and her husband were long identified with: pragmatic and canny in the view of moderates but, to progressives, nothing less than craven accommodation to the nationalism she purportedly wants to tame.Conversely, Mr. Trump has not hesitated to fully leverage the politics of immigration and fear to his advantage. In the days leading up to the midterm elections, Mr. Trump and his aides managed to overcome a steady stream of negative headlines about the brutal killing of a dissident by his close ally, Saudi Arabia, by shifting attention to the caravan of Central Americans traveling toward the United States.The strategy reprised some of the themes that he used to great effect during the 2016 presidential election. Since the midterm election, talk of the caravan has largely dropped off the Republican agenda. Mrs. Clinton was largely absent from the midterm campaigns, and figures on the American left swiftly seized on her comments to argue that she was badly out of step with the Democratic Partys ascendant liberalism and should remain sidelined. Our job on the left, Corey Robin, a progressive author wrote in a stinging Facebook post, is to say: goodbye to all that, were done being done.\", 'extracted_quotes': ['I think Europe needs to get a handle on migration because that is what lit the flame.', 'I admire the very generous and compassionate approaches that were taken particularly by leaders like Angela Merkel, but I think it is fair to say Europe has done its part, and must send a very clear message we are not going to be able to continue provide refuge and support because if we dont deal with the migration issue it will continue to roil the body politic.', 'If shes simply saying you need to cut down on refugees coming to Europe to ask for asylum because they have a well-founded fear of persecution, just to appease some right-wing political leaders, its just not the right thing to do.', 'Ultimately, immigration is not actually the problem that inflamed voters: Much more foundational issues, such as austerity, are the real reason.', 'Maybe Hillary has understood the lesson.', 'Just getting tough without any strategy does the work of the far right.'], 'publication_date': datetime.date(2018, 11, 22), 'keywords': ['Hillary Clinton', 'migration', 'Europe', 'right-wing populism', 'Angela Merkel', 'immigration', 'refugees', 'political turmoil', 'Brexit', 'United States', 'Trump'], 'article_title': 'Hillary Clinton Warns Europe on Migration and Right-Wing Populism', 'primary_category': 'politics', 'content_type': 'analysis', 'mentioned_people': ['Hillary Clinton', 'Angela Merkel', 'Giorgia Meloni', 'Stephen K.

He was 91.The Baseball Hall of Fame, which inducted him in 1975, announced the death.Baseball fans who are short of retirement, especially those in New York, are familiar with Kiner as an announcer who spent half a century with the Mets, enlivening their broadcasts with shrewd analysis, amiable storytelling and memorable malapropisms beginning with their woeful first season in 1962.His genial, well-informed and occasionally tongue-twisted presence accompanied all of Mets history, from the verbal high jinks of Casey Stengel and the fielding high jinks of Marv Throneberry to the arrival of the fireballer Tom Seaver and the miraculous World Series championship of 1969, from the thrilling 1986 Series victory over the Red Sox to the dispiriting Subway Series loss to the Yankees in 2000 and the Madoff-poisoned, injury-riddled ill fortune of recent seasons.But long before he referred on the air to Gary Carter as Gary Cooper, declared that if Casey Stengel were still alive hed be spinning in his grave, or watched a long ball disappear from the park with the trademark call Going, going, gone, goodbye!, Kiner was one of the games great right-handed hitters.Cut short by a back injury, Kiners career on the field was among the most remarkable in baseball history, featuring a concentrated display of power exhibited by few other sluggers. Slow afoot and undistinguished as an outfielder, he was nonetheless among the signature stars of the baseball era immediately after World War II, in the same conversation with Joe DiMaggio, Ted Williams and Stan Musial.From 1946 to 1955, playing for the Pittsburgh Pirates, the Chicago Cubs and the Cleveland Indians, he totaled 369 home runs, twice hitting more than 50 in a season, and drove in 1,015 runs, an average of more than 100 a year.During his first seven seasons, all with Pittsburgh, Kiner led the National League in home runs every year, still a record streak for either league. (Twice he tied with Johnny Mize, once with Hank Sauer.)ImageCredit...Associated PressFrom 1947 to 1951, he had home run totals of 51, 40, 54, 47 and 42, becoming only the second player in history Babe Ruth was the first to hit at least 40 home runs in five consecutive seasons, and the third (after Ruth and Jimmie Foxx) to hit 100 over two consecutive seasons.From 1930, when Hack Wilson hit 56 homers for the Chicago Cubs, to baseballs steroid era in the 1990s, Kiners 54 homers in 1949 was the highest single-season total for a National Leaguer; Henry Aaron never matched him, nor did Willie Mays, Ernie Banks, Mike Schmidt or Willie McCovey, all Hall of Famers with more than 500 career homers.Kiner never made it to the World Series; the Pirates of his era were perpetually mediocre (or worse), and so were the Cubs. In 1955, traded to the American League for his last season, he got closest: the Indians finished second to the Yankees.For a time, Kiner was among baseballs highest-paid players. But after Pittsburghs dreadful 1952 season, when the teams record was 42-112 in spite of Kiners league-leading home run performance, Branch Rickey, the Pirates general manager, cut his salary, reportedly telling him, Son, we can finish last without you.His short career, along with his longtime residence at the bottom of the standings, perhaps explains Kiners relative lack of recognition. When he was finally elected to the Hall of Fame, in 1975, his 15th and final year of eligibility, he sneaked in by two votes, with 273 out of a possible 362.But Kiner was appreciated in other circles. Tall, good-looking and well spoken as a player, he aspired to the career in broadcasting that came to define him he was, in the parlance of the era, a highly eligible bachelor. Introduced to Elizabeth Taylor by Bing Crosby, who was a part owner of the Pirates, he escorted her to the Hollywood premiere of the 1949 war film Twelve OClock High, starring Gregory Peck. When the movie Angels in the Outfield (1951) was filmed at Pittsburghs Forbes Field, Kiner dated its star, Janet Leigh.His courtship of the tennis star Nancy Chaffee, winner of three consecutive national indoor championships, was avidly chronicled by gossip columnists. Their engagement was announced on the radio by Walter Winchell before Kiner actually proposed, and shortly after their marriage, in 1951, the bride wrote an article for The Saturday Evening Post (as told to Al Hirshberg) with the headline Why I Married Ralph Kiner.After she met him, tennis was no longer the most important thing in her life, Chaffee wrote.Even if invited, I wont go back to Wimbledon unless its agreeable to Ralph, she went on. Its too far from Forbes Field, where the Pirates play their home games. For that matter its too far from the cities I hope to visit as a ballplayers wife.ImageCredit...Louis RequenaKiner and Chaffee had three children in a 17-year marriage that ended in divorce in 1968. Chaffee later married the sportscaster Jack Whitaker; she died in 2002. Kiners second marriage, to Barbara George, also ended in divorce. A third marriage, to DiAnn Shugart, ended with her death in 2004, and a fourth, to Ann Benisch, ended in divorce. His survivors include his sons, Ralph and Scott; his daughters, Kathryn Chaffee Freeman, Tracee Kiner Jansen and Kimberlee Kiner; and 12 grandchildren.Ralph McPherran Kiner was born in Santa Rita, N.M., on Oct. 27, 1922. His father, a baker, died when Ralph was 4, and he moved with his mother, Beatrice, a nurse, to Alhambra, Calif., where he grew up playing ball. He signed with the Pirates after graduating from high school, playing two seasons and part of a third in the minor leagues before training as a Navy pilot during World War II. He served in the Pacific, assigned to search for Japanese submarines, though he acknowledged he did not see combat or much else.I was on a few patrols but, gosh, we didnt even spot a whale, he told The New York Times in 1947.At the start of that year, his second in the big leagues, the Pirates acquired the great slugger Hank Greenberg from the Detroit Tigers, and Greenberg became Kiners roommate and mentor (and later his best man at his wedding to Chaffee), advising him on his swing, his preparation, his work ethic.Greenbergs acquisition helped Kiner in more tangible ways as well. For one thing, Greenberg hit behind him in the batting order, protecting him, making sure he got better pitches to hit, and Kiner hit .313, the highest average of his career. Whats more, to accommodate Greenberg, the Pirates had modified Forbes Field, moving in the left field fence to bring it in line with other ballparks and installing the bullpens behind it, an area that came to be called Greenberg Gardens for the long balls the new Pirate was expected to plant there.But it was Kiner who was the primary beneficiary of the change, hitting 51 home runs. Playing what turned out to be his last season, Greenberg hit 25. Greenberg Gardens was rechristened Kiners Korner.The two men were reunited in 1955, when Greenberg, then the general manager of the Indians, acquired Kiner from the Cubs, a transaction complicated by Kiners curious decision to sign a contract for $40,000 a year, less than he was offered and far less than he made the previous year in Chicago, reported to be $65,000.Major league player representatives objected to the contract because it violated the agreement between players and club owners that a players salary could not be reduced by more than 25 percent in a season. Baseballs commissioner, Ford C. Frick, indicated that he would void the contract, and Kiner and Greenberg, who did not want to pay him so little in the first place, eventually renegotiated it.ImageCredit...Associated PressI did not have too good a year with the Cubs, and my salary might have been resented by some players, explained Kiner, who was among the players who fought owners for an improved pension plan. I thought if I had a good season with the Indians in 1955, I could more than make up the cut the following year. At first Greenberg was against it, but he then thought the publicity would be good. At no time did I have in mind to undermine the players. Everyone knows Ive been fighting for them for years.In Cleveland, his back problems worsened. He played only 113 games for the Indians in 1955 and hit a career-low 18 homers, prompting his retirement. For five years afterward he was general manager of the San Diego Padres, then a minor league team, and in 1961 he got his first broadcasting job, calling games on the radio for the Chicago White Sox. The next season the Mets began life in New York, and he was offered a job on their broadcast team, he once said, because I had a lot of experience with losing.Over half a century of Met broadcasts, while sharing the microphone with Lindsey Nelson, Bob Murphy and Tim McCarver whom he once called Tim MacArthur among many others, Kiner proved himself especially valuable in explaining the nuances of hitting, and though occasionally criticized for a flat affect and a penchant for phrase-bungling On Fathers Day we again wish you all happy birthday! he was known as an amusing raconteur who was generally well prepared with both facts and stories, and his intended wit was often as memorable as his unintended humor.Two-thirds of the earth is covered by water, he declared about an especially fleet outfielder. The other third is covered by Garry Maddox. Cutting to a commercial after mistaking McCarvers name for that of the World War II general, he said: MacArthur once said I shall return, and well be back after this.In addition to his game broadcasts, he was the host of the popular postgame interview show Kiners Korner, itself a source of legendary Kinerisms, though he was sometimes outdone by his guests. In one exchange from the early days of the Mets (though not on the show Kiners Korner), he asked a young Mets catcher, Choo Choo Coleman, Whats your wifes name, and whats she like? Coleman replied, Her name is Mrs. Coleman and she likes me, bub. (Years later, Coleman denied this ever happened.)In 1996 Kiner disclosed he had Bells palsy, but he continued to work, albeit with slurred speech. In later years he appeared on broadcasts only sporadically.In 2010 Kiner was described in The New York Times as a human archive of Mets and baseball history, and indeed he had the kind of longevity in the game that allowed him to put one career in perspective as he began his second. In 1961, as Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle pursued Babe Ruths record of 60 home runs in a season, achieved in 1927, Kiner recalled that in 1949, when he was chasing the same mark, it was so revered that he dreaded breaking it. Hed even written a magazine article under the headline The Home Run Id Hate to Hit.Twelve years after I had my 54-homer season, I find myself saying that I wish Id broken the Babes record, he said, going on to predict, wrongly, that Ruths career record of 714 home runs would never be broken. (Henry Aaron and Barry Bonds have both done so.) He could not have known that a new chance at fame awaited him on the airwaves, but he already felt that his accomplishments on the field had faded to obscurity.Ive reached a point now that Im surprised when Im asked for an autograph, he said.

Nursing homes reported nearly 1,800 deaths among their residents and staff in August, which represented the highest monthly toll since February.The findings underscore the ongoing vulnerability of nursing home residents, who are old and in poor health, and highlight the importance of getting booster shots to people in this population. The rising number of infections could fuel more calls to vaccinate nursing home workers ahead of the federal requirement announced in August by President Biden.While the vast majority of Covid-19 deaths happened outside of nursing homes in July and August, the high rate of increase within nursing homes indicates that residents and staff in these settings are at risk of death during the Delta surge, the researchers said. The study, published Friday, did not break out how many of the dead were unvaccinated.August saw a much steeper increase in deaths in nursing homes than in the community at large, said Priya Chidambaram, a senior policy analyst for the foundation and one of the studys authors. Vaccinations are very strongly protecting people in these facilities, but the Delta variant did have an impact, she said.Preliminary data from September may indicate deaths are falling again, she said.Nursing homes were especially hard hit early on in the pandemic, accounting for nearly a third of the countrys overall deaths through the end of June, according to the Kaiser analysis. But the vaccination of residents brought the monthly number of deaths down from a high of around 22,000 in December and January to around 300 for June and July.Although cases did increase, were still nowhere near our peak in December 2020, nor at any point last year, thanks to safe and effective vaccines as well as providers ongoing vaccination efforts and infection control measures, the American Health Care Association, a major nursing home trade group, said in a statement.The association said infections were largely the result of a high number of cases in the surrounding community. The very small number of cases occurring are largely happening in communities where there is high spread and low vaccination rates among the general population, the group said.But the group added that it was encouraged by the recent rollout of booster shots for the Pfizer vaccine and said it was eager to follow any developments regarding the other vaccines.While the vaccination rate among residents is now approaching 85 percent, according to the latest data from the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, only about 65 percent of nursing home employees are vaccinated, roughly the same percentage as American adults overall.The rate of increase among staff is slower than among residents, Ms. Chidambaram said.', 'extracted_quotes': ['Vaccinations are very strongly protecting people in these facilities, but the Delta variant did have an impact.', 'Although cases did increase, were still nowhere near our peak in December 2020, nor at any point last year, thanks to safe and effective vaccines as well as providers ongoing vaccination efforts and infection control measures.', 'The very small number of cases occurring are largely happening in communities where there is high spread and low vaccination rates among the general population.'], 'publication_date': datetime.date(2021, 10, 3), 'keywords': ['Delta variant', 'nursing homes', 'COVID-19 deaths', 'vaccination', 'booster shots', 'Kaiser Family Foundation', 'Pfizer vaccine', 'nursing home staff'], 'generated_title': 'Delta Variant Causes Spike in Nursing Home Deaths, Study Finds', 'primary_category': 'health', 'content_type': 'reporting', 'mentioned_people': ['Priya Chidambaram', 'Joseph Biden'], 'mentioned_organizations': ['Kaiser Family Foundation', 'American Health Care Association', 'Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services'], 'mentioned_legislation': 'None', 'mentioned_locations': 'None', 'sentiment_tone': 'neutral'}) (input_keys={'article_text'}): 'list' object has no attribute 'lower'.

He was 91.The Baseball Hall of Fame, which inducted him in 1975, announced the death.Baseball fans who are short of retirement, especially those in New York, are familiar with Kiner as an announcer who spent half a century with the Mets, enlivening their broadcasts with shrewd analysis, amiable storytelling and memorable malapropisms beginning with their woeful first season in 1962.His genial, well-informed and occasionally tongue-twisted presence accompanied all of Mets history, from the verbal high jinks of Casey Stengel and the fielding high jinks of Marv Throneberry to the arrival of the fireballer Tom Seaver and the miraculous World Series championship of 1969, from the thrilling 1986 Series victory over the Red Sox to the dispiriting Subway Series loss to the Yankees in 2000 and the Madoff-poisoned, injury-riddled ill fortune of recent seasons.But long before he referred on the air to Gary Carter as Gary Cooper, declared that if Casey Stengel were still alive hed be spinning in his grave, or watched a long ball disappear from the park with the trademark call Going, going, gone, goodbye!, Kiner was one of the games great right-handed hitters.Cut short by a back injury, Kiners career on the field was among the most remarkable in baseball history, featuring a concentrated display of power exhibited by few other sluggers. Slow afoot and undistinguished as an outfielder, he was nonetheless among the signature stars of the baseball era immediately after World War II, in the same conversation with Joe DiMaggio, Ted Williams and Stan Musial.From 1946 to 1955, playing for the Pittsburgh Pirates, the Chicago Cubs and the Cleveland Indians, he totaled 369 home runs, twice hitting more than 50 in a season, and drove in 1,015 runs, an average of more than 100 a year.During his first seven seasons, all with Pittsburgh, Kiner led the National League in home runs every year, still a record streak for either league. (Twice he tied with Johnny Mize, once with Hank Sauer.)ImageCredit...Associated PressFrom 1947 to 1951, he had home run totals of 51, 40, 54, 47 and 42, becoming only the second player in history Babe Ruth was the first to hit at least 40 home runs in five consecutive seasons, and the third (after Ruth and Jimmie Foxx) to hit 100 over two consecutive seasons.From 1930, when Hack Wilson hit 56 homers for the Chicago Cubs, to baseballs steroid era in the 1990s, Kiners 54 homers in 1949 was the highest single-season total for a National Leaguer; Henry Aaron never matched him, nor did Willie Mays, Ernie Banks, Mike Schmidt or Willie McCovey, all Hall of Famers with more than 500 career homers.Kiner never made it to the World Series; the Pirates of his era were perpetually mediocre (or worse), and so were the Cubs. In 1955, traded to the American League for his last season, he got closest: the Indians finished second to the Yankees.For a time, Kiner was among baseballs highest-paid players. But after Pittsburghs dreadful 1952 season, when the teams record was 42-112 in spite of Kiners league-leading home run performance, Branch Rickey, the Pirates general manager, cut his salary, reportedly telling him, Son, we can finish last without you.His short career, along with his longtime residence at the bottom of the standings, perhaps explains Kiners relative lack of recognition. When he was finally elected to the Hall of Fame, in 1975, his 15th and final year of eligibility, he sneaked in by two votes, with 273 out of a possible 362.But Kiner was appreciated in other circles. Tall, good-looking and well spoken as a player, he aspired to the career in broadcasting that came to define him he was, in the parlance of the era, a highly eligible bachelor. Introduced to Elizabeth Taylor by Bing Crosby, who was a part owner of the Pirates, he escorted her to the Hollywood premiere of the 1949 war film Twelve OClock High, starring Gregory Peck. When the movie Angels in the Outfield (1951) was filmed at Pittsburghs Forbes Field, Kiner dated its star, Janet Leigh.His courtship of the tennis star Nancy Chaffee, winner of three consecutive national indoor championships, was avidly chronicled by gossip columnists. Their engagement was announced on the radio by Walter Winchell before Kiner actually proposed, and shortly after their marriage, in 1951, the bride wrote an article for The Saturday Evening Post (as told to Al Hirshberg) with the headline Why I Married Ralph Kiner.After she met him, tennis was no longer the most important thing in her life, Chaffee wrote.Even if invited, I wont go back to Wimbledon unless its agreeable to Ralph, she went on. Its too far from Forbes Field, where the Pirates play their home games. For that matter its too far from the cities I hope to visit as a ballplayers wife.ImageCredit...Louis RequenaKiner and Chaffee had three children in a 17-year marriage that ended in divorce in 1968. Chaffee later married the sportscaster Jack Whitaker; she died in 2002. Kiners second marriage, to Barbara George, also ended in divorce. A third marriage, to DiAnn Shugart, ended with her death in 2004, and a fourth, to Ann Benisch, ended in divorce. His survivors include his sons, Ralph and Scott; his daughters, Kathryn Chaffee Freeman, Tracee Kiner Jansen and Kimberlee Kiner; and 12 grandchildren.Ralph McPherran Kiner was born in Santa Rita, N.M., on Oct. 27, 1922. His father, a baker, died when Ralph was 4, and he moved with his mother, Beatrice, a nurse, to Alhambra, Calif., where he grew up playing ball. He signed with the Pirates after graduating from high school, playing two seasons and part of a third in the minor leagues before training as a Navy pilot during World War II. He served in the Pacific, assigned to search for Japanese submarines, though he acknowledged he did not see combat or much else.I was on a few patrols but, gosh, we didnt even spot a whale, he told The New York Times in 1947.At the start of that year, his second in the big leagues, the Pirates acquired the great slugger Hank Greenberg from the Detroit Tigers, and Greenberg became Kiners roommate and mentor (and later his best man at his wedding to Chaffee), advising him on his swing, his preparation, his work ethic.Greenbergs acquisition helped Kiner in more tangible ways as well. For one thing, Greenberg hit behind him in the batting order, protecting him, making sure he got better pitches to hit, and Kiner hit .313, the highest average of his career. Whats more, to accommodate Greenberg, the Pirates had modified Forbes Field, moving in the left field fence to bring it in line with other ballparks and installing the bullpens behind it, an area that came to be called Greenberg Gardens for the long balls the new Pirate was expected to plant there.But it was Kiner who was the primary beneficiary of the change, hitting 51 home runs. Playing what turned out to be his last season, Greenberg hit 25. Greenberg Gardens was rechristened Kiners Korner.The two men were reunited in 1955, when Greenberg, then the general manager of the Indians, acquired Kiner from the Cubs, a transaction complicated by Kiners curious decision to sign a contract for $40,000 a year, less than he was offered and far less than he made the previous year in Chicago, reported to be $65,000.Major league player representatives objected to the contract because it violated the agreement between players and club owners that a players salary could not be reduced by more than 25 percent in a season. Baseballs commissioner, Ford C. Frick, indicated that he would void the contract, and Kiner and Greenberg, who did not want to pay him so little in the first place, eventually renegotiated it.ImageCredit...Associated PressI did not have too good a year with the Cubs, and my salary might have been resented by some players, explained Kiner, who was among the players who fought owners for an improved pension plan. I thought if I had a good season with the Indians in 1955, I could more than make up the cut the following year. At first Greenberg was against it, but he then thought the publicity would be good. At no time did I have in mind to undermine the players. Everyone knows Ive been fighting for them for years.In Cleveland, his back problems worsened. He played only 113 games for the Indians in 1955 and hit a career-low 18 homers, prompting his retirement. For five years afterward he was general manager of the San Diego Padres, then a minor league team, and in 1961 he got his first broadcasting job, calling games on the radio for the Chicago White Sox. The next season the Mets began life in New York, and he was offered a job on their broadcast team, he once said, because I had a lot of experience with losing.Over half a century of Met broadcasts, while sharing the microphone with Lindsey Nelson, Bob Murphy and Tim McCarver whom he once called Tim MacArthur among many others, Kiner proved himself especially valuable in explaining the nuances of hitting, and though occasionally criticized for a flat affect and a penchant for phrase-bungling On Fathers Day we again wish you all happy birthday! he was known as an amusing raconteur who was generally well prepared with both facts and stories, and his intended wit was often as memorable as his unintended humor.Two-thirds of the earth is covered by water, he declared about an especially fleet outfielder. The other third is covered by Garry Maddox. Cutting to a commercial after mistaking McCarvers name for that of the World War II general, he said: MacArthur once said I shall return, and well be back after this.In addition to his game broadcasts, he was the host of the popular postgame interview show Kiners Korner, itself a source of legendary Kinerisms, though he was sometimes outdone by his guests. In one exchange from the early days of the Mets (though not on the show Kiners Korner), he asked a young Mets catcher, Choo Choo Coleman, Whats your wifes name, and whats she like? Coleman replied, Her name is Mrs. Coleman and she likes me, bub. (Years later, Coleman denied this ever happened.)In 1996 Kiner disclosed he had Bells palsy, but he continued to work, albeit with slurred speech. In later years he appeared on broadcasts only sporadically.In 2010 Kiner was described in The New York Times as a human archive of Mets and baseball history, and indeed he had the kind of longevity in the game that allowed him to put one career in perspective as he began his second. In 1961, as Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle pursued Babe Ruths record of 60 home runs in a season, achieved in 1927, Kiner recalled that in 1949, when he was chasing the same mark, it was so revered that he dreaded breaking it. Hed even written a magazine article under the headline The Home Run Id Hate to Hit.Twelve years after I had my 54-homer season, I find myself saying that I wish Id broken the Babes record, he said, going on to predict, wrongly, that Ruths career record of 714 home runs would never be broken. (Henry Aaron and Barry Bonds have both done so.) He could not have known that a new chance at fame awaited him on the airwaves, but he already felt that his accomplishments on the field had faded to obscurity.Ive reached a point now that Im surprised when Im asked for an autograph, he said.

Nursing homes reported nearly 1,800 deaths among their residents and staff in August, which represented the highest monthly toll since February.The findings underscore the ongoing vulnerability of nursing home residents, who are old and in poor health, and highlight the importance of getting booster shots to people in this population. The rising number of infections could fuel more calls to vaccinate nursing home workers ahead of the federal requirement announced in August by President Biden.While the vast majority of Covid-19 deaths happened outside of nursing homes in July and August, the high rate of increase within nursing homes indicates that residents and staff in these settings are at risk of death during the Delta surge, the researchers said. The study, published Friday, did not break out how many of the dead were unvaccinated.August saw a much steeper increase in deaths in nursing homes than in the community at large, said Priya Chidambaram, a senior policy analyst for the foundation and one of the studys authors. Vaccinations are very strongly protecting people in these facilities, but the Delta variant did have an impact, she said.Preliminary data from September may indicate deaths are falling again, she said.Nursing homes were especially hard hit early on in the pandemic, accounting for nearly a third of the countrys overall deaths through the end of June, according to the Kaiser analysis. But the vaccination of residents brought the monthly number of deaths down from a high of around 22,000 in December and January to around 300 for June and July.Although cases did increase, were still nowhere near our peak in December 2020, nor at any point last year, thanks to safe and effective vaccines as well as providers ongoing vaccination efforts and infection control measures, the American Health Care Association, a major nursing home trade group, said in a statement.The association said infections were largely the result of a high number of cases in the surrounding community. The very small number of cases occurring are largely happening in communities where there is high spread and low vaccination rates among the general population, the group said.But the group added that it was encouraged by the recent rollout of booster shots for the Pfizer vaccine and said it was eager to follow any developments regarding the other vaccines.While the vaccination rate among residents is now approaching 85 percent, according to the latest data from the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, only about 65 percent of nursing home employees are vaccinated, roughly the same percentage as American adults overall.The rate of increase among staff is slower than among residents, Ms. Chidambaram said.', 'extracted_quotes': ['Vaccinations are very strongly protecting people in these facilities, but the Delta variant did have an impact.', 'Although cases did increase, were still nowhere near our peak in December 2020, nor at any point last year, thanks to safe and effective vaccines as well as providers ongoing vaccination efforts and infection control measures.', 'The very small number of cases occurring are largely happening in communities where there is high spread and low vaccination rates among the general population.'], 'publication_date': datetime.date(2021, 10, 3), 'keywords': ['Delta variant', 'nursing homes', 'COVID-19 deaths', 'vaccination', 'booster shots', 'Kaiser Family Foundation', 'Pfizer vaccine', 'nursing home staff'], 'generated_title': 'Delta Variant Causes Spike in Nursing Home Deaths, Study Finds', 'primary_category': 'health', 'content_type': 'reporting', 'mentioned_people': ['Priya Chidambaram', 'Joseph Biden'], 'mentioned_organizations': ['Kaiser Family Foundation', 'American Health Care Association', 'Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services'], 'mentioned_legislation': 'None', 'mentioned_locations': 'None', 'sentiment_tone': 'neutral'}) (input_keys={'article_text'}): 'list' object has no attribute 'lower'.

He was 91.The Baseball Hall of Fame, which inducted him in 1975, announced the death.Baseball fans who are short of retirement, especially those in New York, are familiar with Kiner as an announcer who spent half a century with the Mets, enlivening their broadcasts with shrewd analysis, amiable storytelling and memorable malapropisms beginning with their woeful first season in 1962.His genial, well-informed and occasionally tongue-twisted presence accompanied all of Mets history, from the verbal high jinks of Casey Stengel and the fielding high jinks of Marv Throneberry to the arrival of the fireballer Tom Seaver and the miraculous World Series championship of 1969, from the thrilling 1986 Series victory over the Red Sox to the dispiriting Subway Series loss to the Yankees in 2000 and the Madoff-poisoned, injury-riddled ill fortune of recent seasons.But long before he referred on the air to Gary Carter as Gary Cooper, declared that if Casey Stengel were still alive hed be spinning in his grave, or watched a long ball disappear from the park with the trademark call Going, going, gone, goodbye!, Kiner was one of the games great right-handed hitters.Cut short by a back injury, Kiners career on the field was among the most remarkable in baseball history, featuring a concentrated display of power exhibited by few other sluggers. Slow afoot and undistinguished as an outfielder, he was nonetheless among the signature stars of the baseball era immediately after World War II, in the same conversation with Joe DiMaggio, Ted Williams and Stan Musial.From 1946 to 1955, playing for the Pittsburgh Pirates, the Chicago Cubs and the Cleveland Indians, he totaled 369 home runs, twice hitting more than 50 in a season, and drove in 1,015 runs, an average of more than 100 a year.During his first seven seasons, all with Pittsburgh, Kiner led the National League in home runs every year, still a record streak for either league. (Twice he tied with Johnny Mize, once with Hank Sauer.)ImageCredit...Associated PressFrom 1947 to 1951, he had home run totals of 51, 40, 54, 47 and 42, becoming only the second player in history Babe Ruth was the first to hit at least 40 home runs in five consecutive seasons, and the third (after Ruth and Jimmie Foxx) to hit 100 over two consecutive seasons.From 1930, when Hack Wilson hit 56 homers for the Chicago Cubs, to baseballs steroid era in the 1990s, Kiners 54 homers in 1949 was the highest single-season total for a National Leaguer; Henry Aaron never matched him, nor did Willie Mays, Ernie Banks, Mike Schmidt or Willie McCovey, all Hall of Famers with more than 500 career homers.Kiner never made it to the World Series; the Pirates of his era were perpetually mediocre (or worse), and so were the Cubs. In 1955, traded to the American League for his last season, he got closest: the Indians finished second to the Yankees.For a time, Kiner was among baseballs highest-paid players. But after Pittsburghs dreadful 1952 season, when the teams record was 42-112 in spite of Kiners league-leading home run performance, Branch Rickey, the Pirates general manager, cut his salary, reportedly telling him, Son, we can finish last without you.His short career, along with his longtime residence at the bottom of the standings, perhaps explains Kiners relative lack of recognition. When he was finally elected to the Hall of Fame, in 1975, his 15th and final year of eligibility, he sneaked in by two votes, with 273 out of a possible 362.But Kiner was appreciated in other circles. Tall, good-looking and well spoken as a player, he aspired to the career in broadcasting that came to define him he was, in the parlance of the era, a highly eligible bachelor. Introduced to Elizabeth Taylor by Bing Crosby, who was a part owner of the Pirates, he escorted her to the Hollywood premiere of the 1949 war film Twelve OClock High, starring Gregory Peck. When the movie Angels in the Outfield (1951) was filmed at Pittsburghs Forbes Field, Kiner dated its star, Janet Leigh.His courtship of the tennis star Nancy Chaffee, winner of three consecutive national indoor championships, was avidly chronicled by gossip columnists. Their engagement was announced on the radio by Walter Winchell before Kiner actually proposed, and shortly after their marriage, in 1951, the bride wrote an article for The Saturday Evening Post (as told to Al Hirshberg) with the headline Why I Married Ralph Kiner.After she met him, tennis was no longer the most important thing in her life, Chaffee wrote.Even if invited, I wont go back to Wimbledon unless its agreeable to Ralph, she went on. Its too far from Forbes Field, where the Pirates play their home games. For that matter its too far from the cities I hope to visit as a ballplayers wife.ImageCredit...Louis RequenaKiner and Chaffee had three children in a 17-year marriage that ended in divorce in 1968. Chaffee later married the sportscaster Jack Whitaker; she died in 2002. Kiners second marriage, to Barbara George, also ended in divorce. A third marriage, to DiAnn Shugart, ended with her death in 2004, and a fourth, to Ann Benisch, ended in divorce. His survivors include his sons, Ralph and Scott; his daughters, Kathryn Chaffee Freeman, Tracee Kiner Jansen and Kimberlee Kiner; and 12 grandchildren.Ralph McPherran Kiner was born in Santa Rita, N.M., on Oct. 27, 1922. His father, a baker, died when Ralph was 4, and he moved with his mother, Beatrice, a nurse, to Alhambra, Calif., where he grew up playing ball. He signed with the Pirates after graduating from high school, playing two seasons and part of a third in the minor leagues before training as a Navy pilot during World War II. He served in the Pacific, assigned to search for Japanese submarines, though he acknowledged he did not see combat or much else.I was on a few patrols but, gosh, we didnt even spot a whale, he told The New York Times in 1947.At the start of that year, his second in the big leagues, the Pirates acquired the great slugger Hank Greenberg from the Detroit Tigers, and Greenberg became Kiners roommate and mentor (and later his best man at his wedding to Chaffee), advising him on his swing, his preparation, his work ethic.Greenbergs acquisition helped Kiner in more tangible ways as well. For one thing, Greenberg hit behind him in the batting order, protecting him, making sure he got better pitches to hit, and Kiner hit .313, the highest average of his career. Whats more, to accommodate Greenberg, the Pirates had modified Forbes Field, moving in the left field fence to bring it in line with other ballparks and installing the bullpens behind it, an area that came to be called Greenberg Gardens for the long balls the new Pirate was expected to plant there.But it was Kiner who was the primary beneficiary of the change, hitting 51 home runs. Playing what turned out to be his last season, Greenberg hit 25. Greenberg Gardens was rechristened Kiners Korner.The two men were reunited in 1955, when Greenberg, then the general manager of the Indians, acquired Kiner from the Cubs, a transaction complicated by Kiners curious decision to sign a contract for $40,000 a year, less than he was offered and far less than he made the previous year in Chicago, reported to be $65,000.Major league player representatives objected to the contract because it violated the agreement between players and club owners that a players salary could not be reduced by more than 25 percent in a season. Baseballs commissioner, Ford C. Frick, indicated that he would void the contract, and Kiner and Greenberg, who did not want to pay him so little in the first place, eventually renegotiated it.ImageCredit...Associated PressI did not have too good a year with the Cubs, and my salary might have been resented by some players, explained Kiner, who was among the players who fought owners for an improved pension plan. I thought if I had a good season with the Indians in 1955, I could more than make up the cut the following year. At first Greenberg was against it, but he then thought the publicity would be good. At no time did I have in mind to undermine the players. Everyone knows Ive been fighting for them for years.In Cleveland, his back problems worsened. He played only 113 games for the Indians in 1955 and hit a career-low 18 homers, prompting his retirement. For five years afterward he was general manager of the San Diego Padres, then a minor league team, and in 1961 he got his first broadcasting job, calling games on the radio for the Chicago White Sox. The next season the Mets began life in New York, and he was offered a job on their broadcast team, he once said, because I had a lot of experience with losing.Over half a century of Met broadcasts, while sharing the microphone with Lindsey Nelson, Bob Murphy and Tim McCarver whom he once called Tim MacArthur among many others, Kiner proved himself especially valuable in explaining the nuances of hitting, and though occasionally criticized for a flat affect and a penchant for phrase-bungling On Fathers Day we again wish you all happy birthday! he was known as an amusing raconteur who was generally well prepared with both facts and stories, and his intended wit was often as memorable as his unintended humor.Two-thirds of the earth is covered by water, he declared about an especially fleet outfielder. The other third is covered by Garry Maddox. Cutting to a commercial after mistaking McCarvers name for that of the World War II general, he said: MacArthur once said I shall return, and well be back after this.In addition to his game broadcasts, he was the host of the popular postgame interview show Kiners Korner, itself a source of legendary Kinerisms, though he was sometimes outdone by his guests. In one exchange from the early days of the Mets (though not on the show Kiners Korner), he asked a young Mets catcher, Choo Choo Coleman, Whats your wifes name, and whats she like? Coleman replied, Her name is Mrs. Coleman and she likes me, bub. (Years later, Coleman denied this ever happened.)In 1996 Kiner disclosed he had Bells palsy, but he continued to work, albeit with slurred speech. In later years he appeared on broadcasts only sporadically.In 2010 Kiner was described in The New York Times as a human archive of Mets and baseball history, and indeed he had the kind of longevity in the game that allowed him to put one career in perspective as he began his second. In 1961, as Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle pursued Babe Ruths record of 60 home runs in a season, achieved in 1927, Kiner recalled that in 1949, when he was chasing the same mark, it was so revered that he dreaded breaking it. Hed even written a magazine article under the headline The Home Run Id Hate to Hit.Twelve years after I had my 54-homer season, I find myself saying that I wish Id broken the Babes record, he said, going on to predict, wrongly, that Ruths career record of 714 home runs would never be broken. (Henry Aaron and Barry Bonds have both done so.) He could not have known that a new chance at fame awaited him on the airwaves, but he already felt that his accomplishments on the field had faded to obscurity.Ive reached a point now that Im surprised when Im asked for an autograph, he said.

He was 91.The Baseball Hall of Fame, which inducted him in 1975, announced the death.Baseball fans who are short of retirement, especially those in New York, are familiar with Kiner as an announcer who spent half a century with the Mets, enlivening their broadcasts with shrewd analysis, amiable storytelling and memorable malapropisms beginning with their woeful first season in 1962.His genial, well-informed and occasionally tongue-twisted presence accompanied all of Mets history, from the verbal high jinks of Casey Stengel and the fielding high jinks of Marv Throneberry to the arrival of the fireballer Tom Seaver and the miraculous World Series championship of 1969, from the thrilling 1986 Series victory over the Red Sox to the dispiriting Subway Series loss to the Yankees in 2000 and the Madoff-poisoned, injury-riddled ill fortune of recent seasons.But long before he referred on the air to Gary Carter as Gary Cooper, declared that if Casey Stengel were still alive hed be spinning in his grave, or watched a long ball disappear from the park with the trademark call Going, going, gone, goodbye!, Kiner was one of the games great right-handed hitters.Cut short by a back injury, Kiners career on the field was among the most remarkable in baseball history, featuring a concentrated display of power exhibited by few other sluggers. Slow afoot and undistinguished as an outfielder, he was nonetheless among the signature stars of the baseball era immediately after World War II, in the same conversation with Joe DiMaggio, Ted Williams and Stan Musial.From 1946 to 1955, playing for the Pittsburgh Pirates, the Chicago Cubs and the Cleveland Indians, he totaled 369 home runs, twice hitting more than 50 in a season, and drove in 1,015 runs, an average of more than 100 a year.During his first seven seasons, all with Pittsburgh, Kiner led the National League in home runs every year, still a record streak for either league. (Twice he tied with Johnny Mize, once with Hank Sauer.)ImageCredit...Associated PressFrom 1947 to 1951, he had home run totals of 51, 40, 54, 47 and 42, becoming only the second player in history Babe Ruth was the first to hit at least 40 home runs in five consecutive seasons, and the third (after Ruth and Jimmie Foxx) to hit 100 over two consecutive seasons.From 1930, when Hack Wilson hit 56 homers for the Chicago Cubs, to baseballs steroid era in the 1990s, Kiners 54 homers in 1949 was the highest single-season total for a National Leaguer; Henry Aaron never matched him, nor did Willie Mays, Ernie Banks, Mike Schmidt or Willie McCovey, all Hall of Famers with more than 500 career homers.Kiner never made it to the World Series; the Pirates of his era were perpetually mediocre (or worse), and so were the Cubs. In 1955, traded to the American League for his last season, he got closest: the Indians finished second to the Yankees.For a time, Kiner was among baseballs highest-paid players. But after Pittsburghs dreadful 1952 season, when the teams record was 42-112 in spite of Kiners league-leading home run performance, Branch Rickey, the Pirates general manager, cut his salary, reportedly telling him, Son, we can finish last without you.His short career, along with his longtime residence at the bottom of the standings, perhaps explains Kiners relative lack of recognition. When he was finally elected to the Hall of Fame, in 1975, his 15th and final year of eligibility, he sneaked in by two votes, with 273 out of a possible 362.But Kiner was appreciated in other circles. Tall, good-looking and well spoken as a player, he aspired to the career in broadcasting that came to define him he was, in the parlance of the era, a highly eligible bachelor. Introduced to Elizabeth Taylor by Bing Crosby, who was a part owner of the Pirates, he escorted her to the Hollywood premiere of the 1949 war film Twelve OClock High, starring Gregory Peck. When the movie Angels in the Outfield (1951) was filmed at Pittsburghs Forbes Field, Kiner dated its star, Janet Leigh.His courtship of the tennis star Nancy Chaffee, winner of three consecutive national indoor championships, was avidly chronicled by gossip columnists. Their engagement was announced on the radio by Walter Winchell before Kiner actually proposed, and shortly after their marriage, in 1951, the bride wrote an article for The Saturday Evening Post (as told to Al Hirshberg) with the headline Why I Married Ralph Kiner.After she met him, tennis was no longer the most important thing in her life, Chaffee wrote.Even if invited, I wont go back to Wimbledon unless its agreeable to Ralph, she went on. Its too far from Forbes Field, where the Pirates play their home games. For that matter its too far from the cities I hope to visit as a ballplayers wife.ImageCredit...Louis RequenaKiner and Chaffee had three children in a 17-year marriage that ended in divorce in 1968. Chaffee later married the sportscaster Jack Whitaker; she died in 2002. Kiners second marriage, to Barbara George, also ended in divorce. A third marriage, to DiAnn Shugart, ended with her death in 2004, and a fourth, to Ann Benisch, ended in divorce. His survivors include his sons, Ralph and Scott; his daughters, Kathryn Chaffee Freeman, Tracee Kiner Jansen and Kimberlee Kiner; and 12 grandchildren.Ralph McPherran Kiner was born in Santa Rita, N.M., on Oct. 27, 1922. His father, a baker, died when Ralph was 4, and he moved with his mother, Beatrice, a nurse, to Alhambra, Calif., where he grew up playing ball. He signed with the Pirates after graduating from high school, playing two seasons and part of a third in the minor leagues before training as a Navy pilot during World War II. He served in the Pacific, assigned to search for Japanese submarines, though he acknowledged he did not see combat or much else.I was on a few patrols but, gosh, we didnt even spot a whale, he told The New York Times in 1947.At the start of that year, his second in the big leagues, the Pirates acquired the great slugger Hank Greenberg from the Detroit Tigers, and Greenberg became Kiners roommate and mentor (and later his best man at his wedding to Chaffee), advising him on his swing, his preparation, his work ethic.Greenbergs acquisition helped Kiner in more tangible ways as well. For one thing, Greenberg hit behind him in the batting order, protecting him, making sure he got better pitches to hit, and Kiner hit .313, the highest average of his career. Whats more, to accommodate Greenberg, the Pirates had modified Forbes Field, moving in the left field fence to bring it in line with other ballparks and installing the bullpens behind it, an area that came to be called Greenberg Gardens for the long balls the new Pirate was expected to plant there.But it was Kiner who was the primary beneficiary of the change, hitting 51 home runs. Playing what turned out to be his last season, Greenberg hit 25. Greenberg Gardens was rechristened Kiners Korner.The two men were reunited in 1955, when Greenberg, then the general manager of the Indians, acquired Kiner from the Cubs, a transaction complicated by Kiners curious decision to sign a contract for $40,000 a year, less than he was offered and far less than he made the previous year in Chicago, reported to be $65,000.Major league player representatives objected to the contract because it violated the agreement between players and club owners that a players salary could not be reduced by more than 25 percent in a season. Baseballs commissioner, Ford C. Frick, indicated that he would void the contract, and Kiner and Greenberg, who did not want to pay him so little in the first place, eventually renegotiated it.ImageCredit...Associated PressI did not have too good a year with the Cubs, and my salary might have been resented by some players, explained Kiner, who was among the players who fought owners for an improved pension plan. I thought if I had a good season with the Indians in 1955, I could more than make up the cut the following year. At first Greenberg was against it, but he then thought the publicity would be good. At no time did I have in mind to undermine the players. Everyone knows Ive been fighting for them for years.In Cleveland, his back problems worsened. He played only 113 games for the Indians in 1955 and hit a career-low 18 homers, prompting his retirement. For five years afterward he was general manager of the San Diego Padres, then a minor league team, and in 1961 he got his first broadcasting job, calling games on the radio for the Chicago White Sox. The next season the Mets began life in New York, and he was offered a job on their broadcast team, he once said, because I had a lot of experience with losing.Over half a century of Met broadcasts, while sharing the microphone with Lindsey Nelson, Bob Murphy and Tim McCarver whom he once called Tim MacArthur among many others, Kiner proved himself especially valuable in explaining the nuances of hitting, and though occasionally criticized for a flat affect and a penchant for phrase-bungling On Fathers Day we again wish you all happy birthday! he was known as an amusing raconteur who was generally well prepared with both facts and stories, and his intended wit was often as memorable as his unintended humor.Two-thirds of the earth is covered by water, he declared about an especially fleet outfielder. The other third is covered by Garry Maddox. Cutting to a commercial after mistaking McCarvers name for that of the World War II general, he said: MacArthur once said I shall return, and well be back after this.In addition to his game broadcasts, he was the host of the popular postgame interview show Kiners Korner, itself a source of legendary Kinerisms, though he was sometimes outdone by his guests. In one exchange from the early days of the Mets (though not on the show Kiners Korner), he asked a young Mets catcher, Choo Choo Coleman, Whats your wifes name, and whats she like? Coleman replied, Her name is Mrs. Coleman and she likes me, bub. (Years later, Coleman denied this ever happened.)In 1996 Kiner disclosed he had Bells palsy, but he continued to work, albeit with slurred speech. In later years he appeared on broadcasts only sporadically.In 2010 Kiner was described in The New York Times as a human archive of Mets and baseball history, and indeed he had the kind of longevity in the game that allowed him to put one career in perspective as he began his second. In 1961, as Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle pursued Babe Ruths record of 60 home runs in a season, achieved in 1927, Kiner recalled that in 1949, when he was chasing the same mark, it was so revered that he dreaded breaking it. Hed even written a magazine article under the headline The Home Run Id Hate to Hit.Twelve years after I had my 54-homer season, I find myself saying that I wish Id broken the Babes record, he said, going on to predict, wrongly, that Ruths career record of 714 home runs would never be broken. (Henry Aaron and Barry Bonds have both done so.) He could not have known that a new chance at fame awaited him on the airwaves, but he already felt that his accomplishments on the field had faded to obscurity.Ive reached a point now that Im surprised when Im asked for an autograph, he said.

Nursing homes reported nearly 1,800 deaths among their residents and staff in August, which represented the highest monthly toll since February.The findings underscore the ongoing vulnerability of nursing home residents, who are old and in poor health, and highlight the importance of getting booster shots to people in this population. The rising number of infections could fuel more calls to vaccinate nursing home workers ahead of the federal requirement announced in August by President Biden.While the vast majority of Covid-19 deaths happened outside of nursing homes in July and August, the high rate of increase within nursing homes indicates that residents and staff in these settings are at risk of death during the Delta surge, the researchers said. The study, published Friday, did not break out how many of the dead were unvaccinated.August saw a much steeper increase in deaths in nursing homes than in the community at large, said Priya Chidambaram, a senior policy analyst for the foundation and one of the studys authors. Vaccinations are very strongly protecting people in these facilities, but the Delta variant did have an impact, she said.Preliminary data from September may indicate deaths are falling again, she said.Nursing homes were especially hard hit early on in the pandemic, accounting for nearly a third of the countrys overall deaths through the end of June, according to the Kaiser analysis. But the vaccination of residents brought the monthly number of deaths down from a high of around 22,000 in December and January to around 300 for June and July.Although cases did increase, were still nowhere near our peak in December 2020, nor at any point last year, thanks to safe and effective vaccines as well as providers ongoing vaccination efforts and infection control measures, the American Health Care Association, a major nursing home trade group, said in a statement.The association said infections were largely the result of a high number of cases in the surrounding community. The very small number of cases occurring are largely happening in communities where there is high spread and low vaccination rates among the general population, the group said.But the group added that it was encouraged by the recent rollout of booster shots for the Pfizer vaccine and said it was eager to follow any developments regarding the other vaccines.While the vaccination rate among residents is now approaching 85 percent, according to the latest data from the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, only about 65 percent of nursing home employees are vaccinated, roughly the same percentage as American adults overall.The rate of increase among staff is slower than among residents, Ms. Chidambaram said.', 'extracted_quotes': ['Vaccinations are very strongly protecting people in these facilities, but the Delta variant did have an impact.', 'Although cases did increase, were still nowhere near our peak in December 2020, nor at any point last year, thanks to safe and effective vaccines as well as providers ongoing vaccination efforts and infection control measures.', 'The very small number of cases occurring are largely happening in communities where there is high spread and low vaccination rates among the general population.'], 'publication_date': datetime.date(2021, 10, 3), 'keywords': ['Delta variant', 'nursing homes', 'COVID-19 deaths', 'vaccination', 'booster shots', 'Kaiser Family Foundation', 'Pfizer vaccine', 'nursing home staff'], 'generated_title': 'Delta Variant Causes Spike in Nursing Home Deaths, Study Finds', 'primary_category': 'health', 'content_type': 'reporting', 'mentioned_people': ['Priya Chidambaram', 'Joseph Biden'], 'mentioned_organizations': ['Kaiser Family Foundation', 'American Health Care Association', 'Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services'], 'mentioned_legislation': 'None', 'mentioned_locations': 'None', 'sentiment_tone': 'neutral'}) (input_keys={'article_text'}): 'list' object has no attribute 'lower'.

Nursing homes reported nearly 1,800 deaths among their residents and staff in August, which represented the highest monthly toll since February.The findings underscore the ongoing vulnerability of nursing home residents, who are old and in poor health, and highlight the importance of getting booster shots to people in this population. The rising number of infections could fuel more calls to vaccinate nursing home workers ahead of the federal requirement announced in August by President Biden.While the vast majority of Covid-19 deaths happened outside of nursing homes in July and August, the high rate of increase within nursing homes indicates that residents and staff in these settings are at risk of death during the Delta surge, the researchers said. The study, published Friday, did not break out how many of the dead were unvaccinated.August saw a much steeper increase in deaths in nursing homes than in the community at large, said Priya Chidambaram, a senior policy analyst for the foundation and one of the studys authors. Vaccinations are very strongly protecting people in these facilities, but the Delta variant did have an impact, she said.Preliminary data from September may indicate deaths are falling again, she said.Nursing homes were especially hard hit early on in the pandemic, accounting for nearly a third of the countrys overall deaths through the end of June, according to the Kaiser analysis. But the vaccination of residents brought the monthly number of deaths down from a high of around 22,000 in December and January to around 300 for June and July.Although cases did increase, were still nowhere near our peak in December 2020, nor at any point last year, thanks to safe and effective vaccines as well as providers ongoing vaccination efforts and infection control measures, the American Health Care Association, a major nursing home trade group, said in a statement.The association said infections were largely the result of a high number of cases in the surrounding community. The very small number of cases occurring are largely happening in communities where there is high spread and low vaccination rates among the general population, the group said.But the group added that it was encouraged by the recent rollout of booster shots for the Pfizer vaccine and said it was eager to follow any developments regarding the other vaccines.While the vaccination rate among residents is now approaching 85 percent, according to the latest data from the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, only about 65 percent of nursing home employees are vaccinated, roughly the same percentage as American adults overall.The rate of increase among staff is slower than among residents, Ms. Chidambaram said.', 'extracted_quotes': ['Vaccinations are very strongly protecting people in these facilities, but the Delta variant did have an impact.', 'Although cases did increase, were still nowhere near our peak in December 2020, nor at any point last year, thanks to safe and effective vaccines as well as providers ongoing vaccination efforts and infection control measures.', 'The very small number of cases occurring are largely happening in communities where there is high spread and low vaccination rates among the general population.'], 'publication_date': datetime.date(2021, 10, 3), 'keywords': ['Delta variant', 'nursing homes', 'COVID-19 deaths', 'vaccination', 'booster shots', 'Kaiser Family Foundation', 'Pfizer vaccine', 'nursing home staff'], 'generated_title': 'Delta Variant Causes Spike in Nursing Home Deaths, Study Finds', 'primary_category': 'health', 'content_type': 'reporting', 'mentioned_people': ['Priya Chidambaram', 'Joseph Biden'], 'mentioned_organizations': ['Kaiser Family Foundation', 'American Health Care Association', 'Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services'], 'mentioned_legislation': 'None', 'mentioned_locations': 'None', 'sentiment_tone': 'neutral'}) (input_keys={'article_text'}): 'list' object has no attribute 'lower'.

That is down significantly from the $1 billion valuation that Gilt fetched more than three years ago.A deal could be announced early next year, though people briefed on the talks cautioned that negotiations were still underway and could still fall apart. Gilt is also speaking with a handful of other potential buyers in addition to Hudsons Bay, according to another person briefed on the talks.Should the two sides reach an agreement, it would cap a long and volatile ride for Gilt, which shook up the fashion industry when it opened for business eight years ago. The company focused on so-called flash sales, in which consumers have a limited amount of time to buy clothes, accessories and furniture sold by the site.The business model was so popular that Gilt raised $138 million from investors like SoftBank of Japan and Goldman Sachs in 2011, even as it remained unprofitable. And the online retailer was regarded as a star in New York Citys start-up community.The companys early success bolstered the reputations of its founders, including Alexis Maybank, Alexandra Wilkis Wilson and Kevin P. Ryan, the former chief executive of the online ad company DoubleClick, who also served as chief executive of Gilt.But flash sale sites, like Gilt, have lost their luster as consumers become increasingly desensitized to deals, analysts say.Estimated sales at the biggest flash sale sites, including Gilt, Rue La La and Zulily, have stalled in recent quarters, and Gilt most likely does not turn a profit, according to analysts. Gilts sales came to less than $700 million last year. In February 2015, Gilt raised $50 million in funding from investors led by the equity firm General Atlantic.And it still had not taken a step toward an initial public offering, as had been discussed earlier with investors.Other flash-sales specialists like Groupon have moved away from the model, while Zulily, which catered to mothers, sold itself to the owner of QVC for nearly 15 percent less than its initial public offering price.Hudsons Bay is also looking for a turnaround. The Canadian department store operator, which bought Saks in 2013, has succumbed to wider retail blues, posting an unexpected loss of 4 cents a share in the third quarter.And while acquisitions including the German department store chain Galeria fueled a 34 percent jump in sales, the increase fell short of analyst expectations. During a conference call with investors, executives at Hudsons Bay, which also owns Lord & Taylor, blamed sluggish mall traffic, as well as the abnormally warm weather across much of the eastern United States that has stalled sales of winter items.Despite Gilts misfortunes, Hudsons Bay believes that the online retailer still has cachet. Chief among Gilts attractions is its solid presence in mobile sales, an area in which the brick-and-mortar retailer has been eager to expand.Hudsons Bay intends to combine Gilt with its Saks Off Fifth line of outlet stores, according to one of the people briefed on the matter.A spokesman for Hudsons Bay Company declined to comment. Jennifer Miller, a spokeswoman for Gilt, said in an email that the company had no comment.News of the discussions was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.', 'extracted_quotes': ['The business model was so popular that Gilt raised $138 million from investors like SoftBank of Japan and Goldman Sachs in 2011, even as it remained unprofitable.', \"Hudson's Bay intends to combine Gilt with its Saks Off Fifth line of outlet stores, according to one of the people briefed on the matter.\", 'That is down significantly from the $1 billion valuation that Gilt fetched more than three years ago.'], 'publication_date': datetime.date(2015, 12, 14), 'keywords': ['Gilt Groupe', \"Hudson's Bay Company\", 'flash sales', 'online retail', 'acquisition', 'Saks Fifth Avenue', 'retail industry', 'mobile sales', 'online fashion', 'retail', 'valuation'], 'generated_title': \"Gilt Groupe Nears Deal to Sell to Hudson's Bay at a Discount\", 'primary_category': 'business', 'content_type': 'reporting', 'mentioned_people': ['Alexis Maybank', 'Alexandra Wilkis Wilson', 'Kevin P.

Here, Elizabeth helps her mother, Nancy.Credit...Mark Makela for The New York TimesSlide 1 of 15 Elizabeth Wolf lives with her 81-year-old father and 65-year-old mother who both have dementia. Here, Elizabeth helps her mother, Nancy.Credit...Mark Makela for The New York TimesMarch 4, 2016In 2010, Elizabeth Wolf, then 30, was living in Vermont, working for a nonprofit and happily exploring new pursuits, from raising chickens to contra dancing.But after several disturbing phone calls from and about her parents, Louis and Nancy Brood, she moved back into the split-level in Mt. Laurel, N.J., where she and her siblings had grown up, with her now husband, Casey Wolf. She expected to arrange caregiving help for her parents, then return to Vermont. Five years later, she is still taking care of her 81-year-old father and 65-year-old mother, both with dementia. Ms. Wolf, who volunteers with the Alzheimers Assoication, writes about the experience at upsidedowndaughter.com. Her interview has been edited and condensed for space and clarity.My parents called me one day in March and started singing Happy Birthday. It was unsettling. My birthday is in May.My uncle called, too. He and my father had owned an upholstery shop in Philadelphia for 50 years, and it was really bothering him that my dad couldnt do simple math anymore.I dont remember all the doctors appointments that led to Dad seeing a neurologist, but I do remember the appointment where they subjected him to the mini-mental test. He came away from that examination with an Alzheimers diagnosis.We were very concerned about my mother, too. She was asking us the same questions over and over. I said Id talk to the teacher whose classroom she worked in as an aide.The teacher said, Your mother is basically not functioning. She just sits at a table in the back of the classroom and stares out the window.It had been going on for a long time, and we had all been so focused on my dad we had missed it. We ended up taking her to the same neurologist, and she got an Alzheimers diagnosis, too.I told Casey, Were going to come back for two months, October through December. It became apparent very soon that we would need to stay longer.The doctors told me that people with Alzheimers have an average life span, between diagnosis and death, of five to seven years. So I knew were in this for the long haul, whatever that looks like.Now, every morning, I wake up around 6 or 6:30. Ill bring Dad his medicine.I take Mom to the bathroom. I have to take her every couple of hours, otherwise we have what happened this morning, when theres not only a major accident, but the mess ends up everywhere and I have to get her in the bath.I prepare their breakfast. She takes medicine for diabetes, hypothyroidism, high blood pressure, and shes on seizure medication and two antipsychotics because she has hallucinations. She stopped swallowing pills willingly a few years ago we were having all-out wars. Now we hide them in chunks of banana.My dad goes to a day program for adults with Alzheimers and dementia. Five days a week, he gets picked up at 8:40 and comes back between 1 and 1:30.Im always looking for more activities to do with him. I found a local voice teacher, and once a week she plays the piano and they sing together, old songs he has in his deep memory recesses. All the Way. Some Enchanted Evening.My mom doesnt have much of an attention span for activities anymore. A lot of what we do all day is wander and sit and stare out the window.At night, we have a motion sensor so that any time their bedroom door opens if my mom has to go to the bathroom, shell wander into the hallway a receptor in our room bings. It goes off maybe six times a night, on average. Some nights it feels like every half-hour.One night recently my dad was so confused, up so many times, and I was exhausted and full of frustration and anger and overwhelming grief. I just went in there and cried in his arms, begging him, Please, go back to sleep. He didnt understand, but he was holding me and crying, too, and saying, Im so sorry. Ill do better. Ill do better.I dont know how to describe that feeling, where you just dont feel like you can go on anymore. And I know I have a lot of things on my side relative to other people in this situation. A supportive husband. Paid help.We just got a grant from the organization Hilarity for Charity. They gave us 25 hours of care a week for a year. We also have a caregiver from one of the state programs. So now we have help Mondays, Thursdays, Fridays and Sunday mornings.But most of the caregivers arent able to handle my mom in the bathroom or bathe her, so often theyre assisting me. And when I do have help, Im running around trying to do the other thousand things that need to happen to maintain a household. I also work part time from home.Most of my me time is spent going to the gym; I see a therapist and get acupuncture a couple of times a month, too. These are the things I do to stay alive.More than anything, the grief or loss I feel is in the form of loneliness. The isolation. I dont know how to relate to people my age.Once in a while I let myself think about what Ive given up. Casey and I decided not to have children, but I feel like a mother to my parents.I value the incredible intimacy I get to share with them. When I was a teenager, my mother was pretty critical; she ignored me for days at a time. I think she was overwhelmed by motherhood.Now, this role that we share, its changed the dynamic, the history of our relationship. However many years down the line, looking back, Ill think of the moments of tenderness I shared with her, every single day.There was a point in May of 2013 wed been here two and a half years when we had plans to move my parents into a facility. We were going to do a respite stay, and if they fit in, if it went well, wed sell the house.We did everything we could we brought couches and furniture from their bedroom to make the place feel homelike. But it wasnt home. For my dad, it lasted three days. He started having panic attacks, to the point where he was throwing up.He was still with it enough to call us. I remember getting a message from him, weeping. Its Daddy. Please, me and Mom want to come home.Everybody, including his doctor, said, You have to leave him, you have to let him adjust. I couldnt do it. I would never judge the people who do, but I couldnt.Theyve been here 40 years. All my dad ever wanted was this home.

Nursing homes reported nearly 1,800 deaths among their residents and staff in August, which represented the highest monthly toll since February.The findings underscore the ongoing vulnerability of nursing home residents, who are old and in poor health, and highlight the importance of getting booster shots to people in this population. The rising number of infections could fuel more calls to vaccinate nursing home workers ahead of the federal requirement announced in August by President Biden.While the vast majority of Covid-19 deaths happened outside of nursing homes in July and August, the high rate of increase within nursing homes indicates that residents and staff in these settings are at risk of death during the Delta surge, the researchers said. The study, published Friday, did not break out how many of the dead were unvaccinated.August saw a much steeper increase in deaths in nursing homes than in the community at large, said Priya Chidambaram, a senior policy analyst for the foundation and one of the studys authors. Vaccinations are very strongly protecting people in these facilities, but the Delta variant did have an impact, she said.Preliminary data from September may indicate deaths are falling again, she said.Nursing homes were especially hard hit early on in the pandemic, accounting for nearly a third of the countrys overall deaths through the end of June, according to the Kaiser analysis. But the vaccination of residents brought the monthly number of deaths down from a high of around 22,000 in December and January to around 300 for June and July.Although cases did increase, were still nowhere near our peak in December 2020, nor at any point last year, thanks to safe and effective vaccines as well as providers ongoing vaccination efforts and infection control measures, the American Health Care Association, a major nursing home trade group, said in a statement.The association said infections were largely the result of a high number of cases in the surrounding community. The very small number of cases occurring are largely happening in communities where there is high spread and low vaccination rates among the general population, the group said.But the group added that it was encouraged by the recent rollout of booster shots for the Pfizer vaccine and said it was eager to follow any developments regarding the other vaccines.While the vaccination rate among residents is now approaching 85 percent, according to the latest data from the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, only about 65 percent of nursing home employees are vaccinated, roughly the same percentage as American adults overall.The rate of increase among staff is slower than among residents, Ms. Chidambaram said.', 'extracted_quotes': ['Vaccinations are very strongly protecting people in these facilities, but the Delta variant did have an impact.', 'Although cases did increase, were still nowhere near our peak in December 2020, nor at any point last year, thanks to safe and effective vaccines as well as providers ongoing vaccination efforts and infection control measures.', 'The very small number of cases occurring are largely happening in communities where there is high spread and low vaccination rates among the general population.'], 'publication_date': datetime.date(2021, 10, 3), 'keywords': ['Delta variant', 'nursing homes', 'COVID-19 deaths', 'vaccination', 'booster shots', 'Kaiser Family Foundation', 'Pfizer vaccine', 'nursing home staff'], 'generated_title': 'Delta Variant Causes Spike in Nursing Home Deaths, Study Finds', 'primary_category': 'health', 'content_type': 'reporting', 'mentioned_people': ['Priya Chidambaram', 'Joseph Biden'], 'mentioned_organizations': ['Kaiser Family Foundation', 'American Health Care Association', 'Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services'], 'mentioned_legislation': 'None', 'mentioned_locations': 'None', 'sentiment_tone': 'neutral'}) (input_keys={'article_text'}): 'list' object has no attribute 'lower'.

Nursing homes reported nearly 1,800 deaths among their residents and staff in August, which represented the highest monthly toll since February.The findings underscore the ongoing vulnerability of nursing home residents, who are old and in poor health, and highlight the importance of getting booster shots to people in this population. The rising number of infections could fuel more calls to vaccinate nursing home workers ahead of the federal requirement announced in August by President Biden.While the vast majority of Covid-19 deaths happened outside of nursing homes in July and August, the high rate of increase within nursing homes indicates that residents and staff in these settings are at risk of death during the Delta surge, the researchers said. The study, published Friday, did not break out how many of the dead were unvaccinated.August saw a much steeper increase in deaths in nursing homes than in the community at large, said Priya Chidambaram, a senior policy analyst for the foundation and one of the studys authors. Vaccinations are very strongly protecting people in these facilities, but the Delta variant did have an impact, she said.Preliminary data from September may indicate deaths are falling again, she said.Nursing homes were especially hard hit early on in the pandemic, accounting for nearly a third of the countrys overall deaths through the end of June, according to the Kaiser analysis. But the vaccination of residents brought the monthly number of deaths down from a high of around 22,000 in December and January to around 300 for June and July.Although cases did increase, were still nowhere near our peak in December 2020, nor at any point last year, thanks to safe and effective vaccines as well as providers ongoing vaccination efforts and infection control measures, the American Health Care Association, a major nursing home trade group, said in a statement.The association said infections were largely the result of a high number of cases in the surrounding community. The very small number of cases occurring are largely happening in communities where there is high spread and low vaccination rates among the general population, the group said.But the group added that it was encouraged by the recent rollout of booster shots for the Pfizer vaccine and said it was eager to follow any developments regarding the other vaccines.While the vaccination rate among residents is now approaching 85 percent, according to the latest data from the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, only about 65 percent of nursing home employees are vaccinated, roughly the same percentage as American adults overall.The rate of increase among staff is slower than among residents, Ms. Chidambaram said.', 'extracted_quotes': ['Vaccinations are very strongly protecting people in these facilities, but the Delta variant did have an impact.', 'Although cases did increase, were still nowhere near our peak in December 2020, nor at any point last year, thanks to safe and effective vaccines as well as providers ongoing vaccination efforts and infection control measures.', 'The very small number of cases occurring are largely happening in communities where there is high spread and low vaccination rates among the general population.'], 'publication_date': datetime.date(2021, 10, 3), 'keywords': ['Delta variant', 'nursing homes', 'COVID-19 deaths', 'vaccination', 'booster shots', 'Kaiser Family Foundation', 'Pfizer vaccine', 'nursing home staff'], 'generated_title': 'Delta Variant Causes Spike in Nursing Home Deaths, Study Finds', 'primary_category': 'health', 'content_type': 'reporting', 'mentioned_people': ['Priya Chidambaram', 'Joseph Biden'], 'mentioned_organizations': ['Kaiser Family Foundation', 'American Health Care Association', 'Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services'], 'mentioned_legislation': 'None', 'mentioned_locations': 'None', 'sentiment_tone': 'neutral'}) (input_keys={'article_text'}): 'list' object has no attribute 'lower'.
