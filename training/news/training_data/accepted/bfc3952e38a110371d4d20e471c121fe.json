The former players Bernie Nicholls, Bob Bourne, Scott Parker and Bruce Bell join nine players who publicly filed the original suit in November in federal court in the District of Columbia. The lawyers said additional players were part of the suit but had declined to be publicly identified. Gary Leeman, a former Toronto Maple Leafs player, is the lead publicly named plaintiff in the suit, which contends that the N.H.L. failed to adequately respond to serious health risks posed by head injuries in league games.The lawsuit was filed about three months after the N.F.L. agreed to pay $765 million to settle hundreds of cases brought by more than 4,000 retired players who said that the league knew about the dangers of repeated hits to the head but failed to properly warn the players; the judge in the case rejected the settlement last month. Similar suits have been filed against the N.C.A.A.Nicholls, 52, was an All-Star center who scored 70 goals for the Los Angeles Kings in the 1988-89 season. Bourne, 59, was a regular wing on the Islanders teams that won four straight Stanley Cups from 1980 through 1983; he scored 35 goals in 1980-81.Parker, 36, was an enforcer nicknamed The Sheriff with the Colorado Avalanche and the San Jose Sharks. He retired after the 2007-8 season with 85 N.H.L. preseason and regular-season fights. Bell, 49, was a rushing defenseman with the St. Louis Blues whose career was marked when he was knocked out by a body check by Torontos Wendel Clark.These additional four publicly named plaintiffs have shown the courage to stand up for their former teammates, Mel Owens, a player for 10 years in the N.F.L. and a lawyer representing the players, said in a statement.An N.H.L. spokesman said the league had no new comment to join the suit.Bill Daly, the deputy commissioner, said in November the league intended to defend the case vigorously.", "generated_title": "More Ex-Players Join Concussion Suit Against N.H.L.", "publication_date": "2014-02-21", "primary_category": "sports", "content_type": "reporting", "keywords": ["NHL", "concussion lawsuit", "former players", "Gary Leeman", "Bernie Nicholls", "Bob Bourne", "Scott Parker", "Bruce Bell", "head injuries", "NFL settlement", "NCAA"], "mentioned_people": ["Gary Leeman", "Bernie Nicholls", "Bob Bourne", "Scott Parker", "Bruce Bell", "Wendel Clark", "Mel Owens", "Bill Daly"], "mentioned_organizations": ["NHL", "NFL", "NCAA", "Toronto Maple Leafs", "Los Angeles Kings", "Colorado Avalanche", "San Jose Sharks", "St. Louis Blues", "New York Islanders"], "mentioned_legislation": null, "mentioned_locations": ["District of Columbia"], "sentiment_tone": "neutral", "extracted_quotes": ["These additional four publicly named plaintiffs have shown the courage to stand up for their former teammates.", "Bill Daly, the deputy commissioner, said in November the league intended to defend the case vigorously."], "snippet": "Four more former N.H.L. players, including Bernie Nicholls and Bob Bourne, have joined a concussion lawsuit against the league, alleging it failed to adequately respond to serious health risks posed by head injuries in games."}
