He is despised for his complicity in the Holocaust.ImageCredit...Associated Press PhotoI pardon nothing, but I erase nothing of our history, Mr. Macron added.The 40-year-old French president, sliding in the polls, is gaining a reputation for making awkward or shocking statements. In September, he told an out-of-work gardener that he need only cross the street to find a job.But Wednesdays remarks struck a chord in a nation that has lived through two world wars and only in recent decades has acknowledged its collaborationist past.Former President Jacques Chirac admitted in 1995 that Petains Vichy government, which collaborated with the Nazis, was the French state. Mr. Chirac spoke at the Vel dHiv cycling stadium in Paris, known for a 1942 roundup of French Jews that saw 13,000 people deported to Nazi concentration camps, a third of them children.Frances leading Jewish organization, known by the initials C.R.I.F., issued a searing criticism of Macrons stance.I am shocked by this statement by Macron, said its president, Francis Kalifat. Petain was the person who allowed the deportation of 76,000 French Jews to death camps.Mr. Kalifat said it was an insult that a French president could honor Petain on the same level as the other generals. But he acknowledged the marshals pivotal role in the Great War that earned him the nickname Lion of Verdun.The French government spokesman, Benjamin Griveaux, insisted the issue was a false controversy. He quoted Gen. Charles de Gaulle, leader of the Free French forces in World War II and the nations universal hero, as saying of Petain in 1966 that the glory he earned in Verdun can be neither contested nor go unrecognized by the nation.", "generated_title": "Macron's Controversial Praise of World War I General Who Collaborated With Nazis", "publication_date": "2018-11-07", "primary_category": "world", "content_type": "reporting", "keywords": ["Emmanuel Macron", "Philippe Petain", "World War I", "World War II", "Nazi collaboration", "Vichy France", "French Jews", "C.R.I.F.", "Verdun", "Holocaust", "French history", "Charles de Gaulle"], "mentioned_people": ["Emmanuel Macron", "Philippe Petain", "Francis Kalifat", "Jacques Chirac", "Charles de Gaulle", "Benjamin Griveaux"], "mentioned_organizations": ["C.R.I.F.", "Vichy government", "Free French forces", "Vichy France"], "mentioned_legislation": null, "mentioned_locations": ["France", "Verdun", "Charleville-Mezieres", "Paris", "Invalides monument"], "sentiment_tone": "neutral", "extracted_quotes": ["I pardon nothing, but I erase nothing of our history.", "Marshal Petain was also a great soldier during World War I even though he made fatal choices during the Second World War.", "I am shocked by this statement by Macron.
