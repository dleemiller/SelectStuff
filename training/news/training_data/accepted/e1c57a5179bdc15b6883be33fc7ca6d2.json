{"article_text":"VideotranscripttranscriptWho Is the Real Melania Trump? Who Knows?Melania Trump prizes her privacy. But the first ladys absence from the public eye has led to very different narratives about who she is.Melania Trump. Is she trapped? A reluctant first lady? Or is she poised, polished and a quiet, but supportive, first lady? Who is the real Melania? Very few, at least among those who are speaking publicly, will say. Im very strong. People, they dont really know me. People think and talk about me like, Oh, Melania. Oh, poor Melania. Dont feel sorry for me. Dont feel sorry for me. I can handle everything. But as Donald Trumps presidency has progressed, the first lady has become a versatile avatar, her image split sharply down political lines. In one version of the public imagination, Melania is unhappy. She dislikes her husband and disagrees with his policies. She may even be mulling a divorce. This Melania has shown up on late-night TV and in tabloids. Youre beautiful, dutiful Melania. I cant take it anymore. Then theres the other version of Melania, painted by conservative media as confident, fashion forward, graceful and adored. I have been so impressed with, not just her quiet dignity, as you brought up, but also just this diplomatic use of fashion. This version is closer to the official portrayal of Melania. Through her spokespeople, the first lady says she is supportive of her husband and focused on raising their son, Barron. I support my husband 100 percent. But we have a 9-year-old son together, Barron. And Im raising him. She says she prefers to take a back seat to her husband, to keep his place in the limelight. Its not the first time Melanias been in the public eye. You spin, baby, you spin. Shes a former model and jewelry designer. I love when idea comes to life. And I study architecture and design and its something very creative for me. Im very passionate about what I design, and there are some beautiful pieces. When they got together in the late 1990s, the Trumps say their chemistry was instant. We were both at the same party and thats how we met. He came to me... Like her right away? I went crazy. Melania and Donald became synonymous with the New York social scene. Theyve stood did together for a number of years now. New Yorkers have come to know them as a very solid couple. And in 2005, they married. Hi, fans. Im going to Metropolitan Gala. In the following years, Melanias social media posts focused on fashion, travel, fitness and spending time with family. Now as the first lady, next to one of the most outspoken presidents in recent history, Melanias silence has taken on a life of its own. The most important thing is just to be you. Thats the end.Melania Trump prizes her privacy. But the first ladys absence from the public eye has led to very different narratives about who she is.CreditCredit...Al Drago/The New York TimesJune 6, 2018WASHINGTON After spending nearly a month out of the public eye, Melania Trump emerged from the White House on Wednesday, putting an end to at least a few of the theories some her husband has repeated to his 52 million Twitter followers that blossomed like swampland ragweed during her time in seclusion.Dressed in a trench coat and heels, the first lady accompanied President Trump to the headquarters of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to attend a briefing on the coming hurricane season. Sitting nearly still, Mrs. Trump cut a totemic figure alongside Mr. Trump as they sat around a conference table at the agencys headquarters.The president, reading from a notecard, introduced our great first lady to several members of his cabinet, Vice President Mike Pence and an assembled group of reporters.She went through a little rough patch, but shes doing great, Mr. Trump said, patting his wife on the hand. The people love you. Thank you, honey.Mrs. Trump spent five days at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in May to treat what her aides called a benign kidney condition, and had not appeared in public since before entering the hospital.On Twitter Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump bitterly complained about the speculation by the public and some journalists about her absence. But in attacking what he said were several conspiracy theories the news media had generated about his wifes absence, he ended up repeating the kind of unfounded rumors about his wife that would normally attract legal action from him and his notoriously litigious family.The Fake News Media has been so unfair, and vicious, to my wife and our great first lady, Melania, wrote the president, who has long reveled in conspiracy theories. During her recovery from surgery they reported everything from near death, to facelift, to left the W.H. (and me) for N.Y. or Virginia, to abuse. All Fake, she is doing really well!By attacking journalists who have speculated or asked questions about his wife, the president put himself at odds with his own personal history of using his platform and a number of his supporters to target women and effectively amplify rumors about their health, appearance and personal relationships.On the campaign trail, he repeatedly attacked Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent, suggesting that she was not loyal to her husband, President Bill Clinton; questioning her physical stamina for the job; and suggesting that she was mentally ill. Mr. Trumps campaign also aired at least one TV ad that pointed to conspiracy theories about Mrs. Clintons health.And he later took aim at two female journalists Megyn Kelly and Mika Brzezinski describing them in pejorative terms. He said that he once saw Ms. Brzezinski at a gathering at his Florida estate bleeding badly from a face-lift and that she had a low I.Q.In Mrs. Trumps case, the White House has insisted that she is entitled to the same privacy that would shield any other patient.She surfaced for the first time on Tuesday in a closed White House event, but was spotted around the White House last week. Apparently referring to this, the president said on Twitter that reporters had seen the first lady merrily strolling in the White House over the past week, but never reported the sighting because it would hurt the sick narrative that she was living in a different part of the world, was really ill, or whatever. Fake News is really bad!But at least one reporter noted on Twitter that he had seen the first lady with her aides in the White House, and her office has said Mrs. Trump has taken several internal meetings during her recovery.With the White House declining to issue updates on the first ladys recovery, the guesswork about her whereabouts and her health expanded beyond the news media: On Tuesday, as Mrs. Trump attended the event with Gold Star families, a contingent of observers on Twitter wondered whether the sparse footage captured of the event was indeed from that day.Historians say no modern first lady has prized her privacy more than Mrs. Trump, but the timing of Mrs. Trumps departure from the public eye was abrupt and baffling: It came as she was ramping up her public appearances and in the midst of rolling out her official platform, Be Best, which will focus on childrens issues.Mrs. Trumps stay in the hospital was also shrouded in secrecy. In the hours after her procedure, aides wore scrubs around her but said the procedure had been successful and without complications.In any case, the first ladys public re-emergence is tied to one of her interests. Stephanie Grisham, her communications director, said in an email that Mrs. Trump would be attending the hurricane briefing because it is an issue that she cares very much about.Last year, the first lady and her husband traveled to Puerto Rico to visit families affected by hurricanes, serving them food and visiting relief centers.When asked about the first ladys health, Ms. Grishams response was brief.She feels great, Ms. Grisham wrote, doing well.At the FEMA briefing, Mrs. Trump did not speak publicly, but listened, smiling at her husband and nodding as he spoke. As the event drew to a close, the president referred to his wife and Mr. Pence.Speaking for Melania and Mike, Mr. Trump said, we thank you all very much.","generated_title":"Who Is the Real Melania Trump?
