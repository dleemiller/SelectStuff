F.C. is jointly owned by City of Englands Premier League and the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball).We will have the ability to take four players on loan from the club here, so Im looking a lot at the younger players, and the U18s and the U21s at the moment, he said. And also the players that are out on loan.We have a very big interest in bringing some City players over to join us in New York and I certainly think theres the talent there. And the ambition is there as well, so well have to get with those guys over the next six months to a year and see whether or not thats something they would like as well.Kreis, the former coach of Real Salt Lake, was named coach of the new M.L.S. club in early January. He plans to live in Manchester for the next six months in an effort to absorb the clubs culture and way of doing business ... and soccer. At the news conference introducing Kreis, club officials said the new team would probably also avail itself of the league maximum of three designated players.Last week, N.Y.C. F.C. also invited fans to chime in and create badges for the club, badges that will be part of a larger mosaic and that probably will not end up as the teams official crest. Some examples of fans submissions are here.","generated_title":"Kreis in Manchester: Settling In","publication_date":"2014-02-08","primary_category":"sports","content_type":"reporting","keywords":["Jason Kreis","New York City FC","Major League Soccer","Manchester City","Premier League","New York Yankees","soccer","coach","loan players","fan engagement","U18s","U21s","Real Salt Lake"],"mentioned_people":["Jason Kreis"],"mentioned_organizations":["New York City FC","Major League Soccer","Manchester City","Premier League","New York Yankees","Real Salt Lake"],"mentioned_legislation":null,"mentioned_locations":["Manchester","New York"],"sentiment_tone":"neutral","extracted_quotes":["We will have the ability to take four players on loan from the club here, so I'm looking a lot at the younger players, and the U18s and the U21s at the moment.","We have a very big interest in bringing some City players over to join us in New York and I certainly think there's the talent there.
