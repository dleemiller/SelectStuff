{"article_text": "Before Coming Out, a Hard Time Growing UpVideoMichael Sam, a defensive end at Missouri who will enter the N.F.L. draft, announced Sunday that he was gay. People in his hometown of Hitchcock, Tex., and on his college team voiced their support.CreditCredit...John Francis Peters for The New York TimesFeb. 11, 2014COLUMBIA, Mo. Michael Sam was the loud country boy who wore a tank top and a cowboy hat. He was the smooth-singing baritone who could irritate his coaches and crack up his teammates with his improvised songs.He was one of the best players to come out of tiny Hitchcock, Tex., where his family was well known for all the wrong reasons. He was an all-American and defensive terror on the football field. He was a regular at the gay club, where the bartenders knew him by name.Sam introduced himself to the world Sunday night as a National Football League prospect who happens to be gay. Now he is poised to become a trailblazer in a violent and macho world that will scrutinize his every action and turn his private life into a very public debate.But Sam has never had it easy. He grew up about 40 miles southeast of Houston near Galveston Bay in Texas, the seventh of eight children. Three of his siblings have died and two brothers are in prison. He lived briefly in the back seat of his mothers car, and his relationship with his family remains complicated: When he visits home, he usually stays with friends.Sams life has transformed overnight. His announcement this week prompted a state senator in Missouri to seek legislation to bar discrimination based on sexual orientation. His courage has been hailed by teammates, famous athletes, countless football fans and President Obama and the first lady.But to get a sense of the challenges awaiting Sam, look no further than his father.Last Tuesday, Michael Sam Sr. was at a Dennys near his home outside Dallas to celebrate his birthday when his son sent him a text message.Dad, Im gay, he wrote.The party stopped cold. I couldnt eat no more, so I went to Applebees to have drinks, Sam Sr. said. I dont want my grandkids raised in that kind of environment.Im old school, he added. Im a man-and-a-woman type of guy. As evidence, he pointed out that he had taken an older son to Mexico to lose his virginity.ImageCredit...Scott Dalton for The New York TimesOn Sunday night, just after Michael Sam announced his intention to make sports history, his father was still struggling with the news.Sam Sr. loves his son, and he said he hoped his son made it to the N.F.L. As a black man, we have so many hurdles to cross, he said. This is just one he has to cross.But he expressed discomfort at the very idea of a gay N.F.L. player, even if the player was his son. He grumbled that Deacon Jones, the Hall of Fame defensive end renowned for his toughness, is turning over in his grave.Michael Sam had anticipated his familys uneasiness. In an interview Sunday in North Hollywood, Calif., he spoke about his tough upbringing, which he said was more challenging than the decision to come out publicly.Im closer to my friends than I am to my family, Sam said.He declined to speak beyond the initial interview Sunday.Indeed, Sam had begun telling small groups of his University of Missouri teammates that he was gay two years earlier. In August, he told the whole group, along with the coaching staff. Most of them already knew.If he was not quite public about his sexuality, he certainly was not hiding it. His self-confidence blossomed, along with his game.I think mostly why Mike had such a great season this year is that he could be himself, said LDamian Washington, a wide receiver and close friend. He got that big boulder off his back. Like, finally. I think it was a huge relief. He could be himself and not always be hiding something from everybody.ImageCredit...Scott Dalton for The New York TimesThe Notorious SamsAs a boy growing up in Hitchcock, Michael Sam may not yet have known exactly who he was, but he did know what he needed. He needed to play sports. He needed to be part of a team.Life had hardly been kind to him or his family. Michael Sr. and his mother, JoAnn Sam, were separated after having eight children. He went to North Texas to work as a trucker. She tried to keep what was left of her family together.A sister drowned when she was 2, before Michael was born, when another child accidentally knocked her off a fishing pier. Another brother, Russell, was 15 when he was shot and killed trying to break into a home, in what his father said was part of a gang initiation. Another brother, Julian, has not been heard from since he left for work one day in 1998; his family believes he is dead. Two others are in jail.It was very hard growing up in that environment, Sam said. My family was very notorious in the town that we lived in. Everyone would say, There goes those damn Sams. I didnt want to paint that ill picture of me. I knew the good in my family. They didnt know our background and the adversity we had to endure. I wanted to succeed and be a beacon of hope in my family.If trouble runs deep in the Sam family, so does religion. And it, too, was a source of conflict. JoAnn is a member of the Jehovahs Witnesses, who do not celebrate holidays or believe in most birth control and generally shun participation in organized sports. Michael Sr. comes from a large Baptist family, and his father was a long-serving deacon at a church in nearby Texas City, Tex.But it was Sams desire to play football that caused a rift with his mother she believed that sports distracted from the mission of service. Sam simply saw football as salvation.There were confrontations, Michael said. I love my mother dearly. But I needed sports. I needed sports to make sure I cant get in trouble, to make sure I didnt do anything bad.Efforts to reach JoAnn Sam through her son, friends and at listed phone numbers and addresses failed.ImageCredit...Scott Dalton for The New York TimesNobody in Sams family had attended college, and Sam did not believe he would be the first. But as he coped with a disjointed family and wrestled with his sexuality, one certainty emerged in his life: He needed to get out of Hitchcock. He knew his best chance was through football.A Second HomeHitchcock High School sits on a long, quiet road, between a general store and the First Baptist Church. Freight trains rumble nearby. On fall nights, many of the towns 7,000 residents gather at the stadium to watch their Bulldogs play.It was there that Sam developed a controlled fury that helped him sack quarterbacks and collar running backs. It was there that he found an extended family that includes a prominent banker, an old football coach and a 3-year-old goddaughter named Peighton, who sees him adoringly as a giant.Sam began his football career as a water boy. In junior high school, Craig Smith, the football coach, saw that Sam was athletically blessed and, even better, hungry for guidance and camaraderie. The coaches drafted him to carry equipment and hang around the squad.At the start of high school, Smith put him in the starting lineup on the varsity team. Sam was already so much bigger than his teammates that he stood in the back row of the teams yearbook photograph.Sam was a natural peacemaker, but he was not afraid to use his size when needed. When he saw Robert Dohman, a friend since elementary school, with a busted lip outside a local mall, he waded into a crowd of two dozen and lifted the offender into the air.What do you know about jumping the white boy in the parking lot? Sam shouted, according to Dohman.The crowd scattered.He was trying to protect me, Dohman said.By his sophomore year, Sam played on the offensive and defensive lines. How good was he? Coach Smith did not know: Hitchcock, with only 300 students, was hardly a football powerhouse.ImageCredit...August Kryger for The New York TimesBut Smith had a hint of his potential in Sams senior year when the Bulldogs played Chavez High School, a much bigger school in Houston. It was the teams first game after Hurricane Ike devastated the region and closed the school for several weeks.Chavezs star was an all-American defensive tackle named Michael Brockers, who was bound for Louisiana State University. In 2012, the St. Louis Rams drafted him in the first round. Sam more than kept up with Brockers.We knew right then and there that Michael could really play with anybody, Smith said.Sam found a comfortable place off the field as well, in large part because of Ethan Purl, a classmate and the son of Ron Purl, the president of the local branch of Prosperity Bank.Rons wife, Candy, made sure their house was part recreation center and part counseling hub for their children and their friends. By Sams senior year, he had his own bedroom in the Purls house, along with chores like cleaning the pool and carrying the grocery bags.I look at our house as a kind of safe haven, said Ron Purl, who keeps a photograph of Sam in his Missouri football uniform in his office. He is just another son. If he did something wrong, he got yelled at just like the others did.It was the Purls who drove Sam from Texas to middle Missouri. It seemed like an improbable trip at the time.I didnt even dream of going to college, Sam said. College was not in my definition. If somebody told me I was going to play for the Missouri Tigers in 2009, I would laugh at them.Casual DisclosuresSam may have been big for Hitchcock, but he was small on Missouris defensive line. The coaches did not know what to make of their undersize freshman.ImageCredit...August Kryger for The New York TimesHe was a two-star recruit, said Pat Ivey, an associate athletic director who oversees the strength department. I didnt really see him being an all-American.At first, Sams teammates intimidated him. His affinity for Harry Potter books made him stand out. He was noisy and could not sit still. But he won the group over with improvised songs that ribbed teammates or described their grueling practices.Hes got a motor that never stops, defensive lineman Derrion Thomas said. He is a big personality, and when he started with the songs, you just knew that mind never stopped.The same went for his mouth.He drove me crazy, Coach Gary Pinkel said. He never shut up. I knew when he was in my office talking to the secretary. Id get up and shut the door.Before his senior year, Sam had begun telling those closest to him who he really was. He skipped the dramatic pronouncements in favor of casual disclosures. In a phone call to a high school friend, Tyler Sander, Sam confided that he was having romantic troubles. If Sander had been around more during the Christmas break, Sam said, You would have met him.There was a pause and I was like, Him? Sander said.He was like, Yeah, Im gay.Sander and Sam had a long conversation that night that made them even closer. Now theres nothing to hide, Sander said. We can literally talk to each other about anything.Two years ago during Christmas break, Sam brought home a friend from the swimming team, a man. His second family, the Purls, did not ask any questions. When Sam called Ron Purl later to say that he was gay, Purl assured him that he was perfectly fine with it and already knew.His teammates had similar reactions.I practiced across from him three years, and it was just war, said Elvis Fisher, an offensive lineman and captain of the 2012 Missouri team. You dont set out wanting to know each others life, but you spend so much time with each other you cant help but know them. I knew, and I love the guy.ImageCredit...August Kryger for The New York TimesA Singular SeasonBy last August, Sams sexuality was an open secret here. He had told a professor he was gay and had become a genial presence at the SoCo Club in Columbia, a nightclub and cabaret that hosts regular drag shows, among other events.Marty Newman, SoCos owner and general manager, said Sam was open about who he was: a gay man and a football star. He was happy to talk sports with the bartenders and anyone else.No one felt the need to out him, Newman said. He was respected here and was allowed to be himself.In Sams senior season, Missouri finished 12-2 and won the Cotton Bowl. He made first-team all-American and was voted by his teammates as Missouris most valuable player.On Monday, Pinkel tried to put in words a singular season that began with his noisiest players startling announcement, and ended with dozens of men standing by their teammate in the national spotlight.Pretty cool, was the best he could do.On Saturday night, over Chinese food at the home of his publicist, Howard Bragman, Sam was joined by an exclusive group: the fraternity of publicly gay athletes and their peers who have made a cause of supporting them.Dave Kopay and Wade Davis, who came out as gay after retiring from professional football, and Bill Bean, who did so after retiring from professional baseball, were there, along with Brendon Ayanbadejo and Chris Kluwe, two former N.F.L. players who have been outspoken in their support of gay rights.It was a chance to celebrate Sam on his last night of relative anonymity, but it was also a way to tell him about the world he was diving into.Kopay, a 71-year-old former running back, playfully punched Sam a couple of times to emphasize just how intensely he would have to work. He also reminded Sam that if they had been freshmen together in 1960, Sam, as a black man, would not have been entirely welcome. (Norris Stevenson broke the color barrier for Missouri in 1957.)Well, youre just taking another step forward now, Kopay said.Kluwe told him he would not have many problems with players. Theyre there to play football, he said.The men in charge will pose problems, Kluwe said. Its the general managers and coaches who are going to say its a distraction.Then theres the public at large, the millions of sports fans who will soon see a publicly gay player standing tall on an N.F.L. teams defensive line. It is too early to know how they will react, but perhaps the evolution in Sams own family offers a clue.I believe in a persons destiny, his aunt Geraldine Sam said. If thats the way he is, Im not trying to put my religious beliefs on anyone.
