But you dont have to live in those parts of the world to observe it. With only a few hours before the cosmic spectacle starts, here are answers to some questions you might have.When does the eclipse begin?Observers in the first places where the total eclipse will be viewable will see it around midnight G.M.T. on Wednesday (7 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday) and those in the last places to witness it will do so around 4 a.m. G.M.T. (11 p.m. Eastern).How can I watch the eclipse from the other side of the world?You have options.Starting at 6 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday (11 p.m. G.M.T.) the Slooh Community Observatory, which operates a global network of telescopes, will begin broadcasting the eclipse live from Tadulako University in Palu, Indonesia. From their vantage point, the moon will commence consuming the sun at 7:37 p.m. Eastern, casting its entire shadow across the sky for about 2 minutes and 4 seconds.The webcast will end at 9:00 p.m. Eastern and then at midnight staff members at Slooh plan to post a time-lapse video of the entire event.If I miss that show, can I still catch the eclipse?Nearly 1,700 miles away on Woleai atoll in Micronesia, a team from NASA and the San Francisco Exploratorium will also be livestreaming the eclipse beginning at 8 p.m. Eastern. At approximately 8:38 p.m. Eastern, the moon will plunge the island into complete darkness. The sun will re-emerge around 8:42 p.m. Eastern. Several intrepid researchers traveled to the remote island which is 420 miles away from its nearest airport because at 4 minutes and 3 seconds, Woleai offers one of the longest views of the total eclipse.

NASA is also showing raw footage without commentary.How are people sharing photos on social media?Several hashtags on Instagram, Twitter and other social media sites have popped up in preparation for the eclipse including #eclipse2016, #totalsolareclipse and #shadeup, as well as #GerhanaMatahariTotal2016 among users in Indonesia. Those who capture images of the event can also add their photos to the NASA flickr group.How else are people watching the eclipse?About 170 passengers aboard Alaska Airlines Flight 870 will be viewing the eclipse from 36,000 feet in the air as they fly from Anchorage, Alaska, to Honolulu, Hawaii. The airline decided a year ago to delay the flights ordinary schedule by 25 minutes to give astronomers and other eclipse enthusiasts a rare chance to chase the event from the sky. For a minute and 53 seconds of the planes route, the sky will be blacked out.","generated_title":"How to Watch the Total Solar Eclipse","publication_date":"2016-03-08","primary_category":"science","content_type":"reporting","keywords":["total solar eclipse","Southeast Asia","western Pacific","Slooh Community Observatory","NASA","San Francisco Exploratorium","Woleai atoll","Micronesia","Alaska Airlines","eclipse viewing","social media","livestream"],"mentioned_people":null,"mentioned_organizations":["Slooh Community Observatory","NASA","San Francisco Exploratorium","Alaska Airlines"],"mentioned_legislation":null,"mentioned_locations":["Southeast Asia","western Pacific","Palu, Indonesia","Woleai atoll, Micronesia","Anchorage, Alaska","Honolulu, Hawaii","Woleai atoll","Micronesia"],"sentiment_tone":"neutral","extracted_quotes":["With protective glasses at the ready, skywatchers across Southeast Asia and the western Pacific are preparing to witness a total solar eclipse.","Starting at 6 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday (11 p.m. G.M.T.) the Slooh Community Observatory, which operates a global network of telescopes, will begin broadcasting the eclipse live from Tadulako University in Palu, Indonesia.","Nearly 1,700 miles away on Woleai atoll in Micronesia, a team from NASA and the San Francisco Exploratorium will also be livestreaming the eclipse beginning at 8 p.m. Eastern.","About 170 passengers aboard Alaska Airlines Flight 870 will be viewing the eclipse from 36,000 feet in the air as they fly from Anchorage, Alaska, to Honolulu, Hawaii."]}
