{"article_text": "Lil Pump Attention Record Companies ... $15 Mil or Take a Hike 1/27/2018 TMZ.com Lil Pump is super hot these days and he knows it ... because he ain't signing no recording contract for anything less than $15 mil. We got Pump leaving Avianne and Co. Jewelers Friday night in the Big Apple, where he says he dropped a quarter mil on bling. The 17-year-old rapper reportedly got out of his deal with Warner Bros.
