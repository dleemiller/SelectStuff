{"article_text":"The tech giant, which is preparing for a mega I.P.O., has transformed personal finance in China. Regulators have taken notice.Credit...Agence France-Presse Getty ImagesPublished Oct. 26, 2020Updated Jan. 20, 2021As Jack Ma of Alibaba helped turn China into the worlds biggest e-commerce market over the past two decades, he was also vowing to pull off a more audacious transformation.If the banks dont change, well change the banks, he said in 2008, decrying how hard it was for small businesses in China to borrow from government-run lenders.The financial industry needs disrupters, he told Peoples Daily, the official Communist Party newspaper, a few years later. His goal, he said, was to make banks and other state-owned enterprises feel unwell.The scope of Mr. Mas success is becoming clearer. The vehicle for his financial-technology ambitions, an Alibaba spinoff called Ant Group, is preparing for the largest initial public offering on record. Ant is set to raise $34 billion by selling its shares to the public in Hong Kong and Shanghai, according to stock exchange documents released on Monday. After the listing, Ant would be worth around $310 billion, much more than many global banks.The company is going public not as a scrappy upstart, but as a leviathan deeply dependent on the good will of the government Mr. Ma once relished prodding.More than 730 million people use Ants Alipay app every month to pay for lunch, invest their savings and shop on credit. Yet Alipays size and importance have made it an inevitable target for Chinas regulators, which have already brought its business to heel in certain areas.These days, Ant talks mostly about creating partnerships with big banks, not disrupting or supplanting them. Several government-owned funds and institutions are Ant shareholders and stand to profit handsomely from the public offering.The question now is how much higher Ant can fly without provoking the Chinese authorities into clipping its wings further.Excitable investors see Ant as a buzzy internet innovator. The risk is that it becomes more like a heavily regulated financial digital utility, said Fraser Howie, the co-author of Red Capitalism: The Fragile Financial Foundation of Chinas Extraordinary Rise.Utility stocks, as far as I remember, were not the ones to be seen as the most exciting, Mr. Howie said.Ant declined to comment, citing the quiet period demanded by regulators before its share sale.The company has played give-and-take with Beijing for years. As smartphone payments became ubiquitous in China, Ant found itself managing huge piles of money in Alipay users virtual wallets. The central bank made it park those funds in special accounts where they would earn minimal interest.After people piled into an easy-to-use investment fund inside Alipay, the government forced the fund to shed risk and lower returns. Regulators curbed a plan to use Alipay data as the basis for a credit-scoring system akin to Americans FICO scores.Chinas Supreme Court this summer capped interest rates for consumer loans, though it was unclear how the ceiling would apply to Ant. The central bank is preparing a new virtual currency that could compete against Alipay and another digital wallet, the messaging app WeChat, as an everyday payment tool.Ant has learned ways of keeping the authorities on its side. Mr. Ma once boasted at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, about never taking money from the Chinese government. Today, funds associated with Chinas social security system, its sovereign wealth fund, a state-owned life insurance company and the national postal carrier hold stakes in Ant. The I.P.O. is likely to increase the value of their holdings considerably.Thats how the state gets its payoff, Mr. Howie said. With Ant, he said, the line between state-owned enterprise and private enterprise is highly, highly blurred.China, in less than two generations, went from having a state-planned financial system to being at the global vanguard of internet finance, with trillions of dollars in transactions being made on mobile devices each year. Alipay had a lot to do with it.Alibaba created the service in the early 2000s to hold payments for online purchases in escrow. Its broader usefulness quickly became clear in a country that mostly missed out on the credit card era. Features were added and users piled in. It became impossible for regulators and banks not to see the app as a threat.ImageCredit...Alex Plavevski/EPA, via ShutterstockA big test came when Ant began making an offer to Alipay users: Park your money in a section of the app called Yuebao, which means leftover treasure, and we will pay you more than the low rates fixed by the government at banks.People could invest as much or as little as they wanted, making them feel like they were putting their pocket change to use. Yuebao was a hit, becoming one of the worlds largest money market funds.The banks were terrified. One commentator for a state broadcaster called the fund a vampire and a parasite.Still, all the main regulators remained unanimous in saying that this was a positive thing for the Chinese financial system, said Martin Chorzempa, a research fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.If you cant actually reform the banks, Mr. Chorzempa said, you can inject more competition.But then came worries about shadowy, unregulated corners of finance and the dangers they posed to the wider economy. Today, Chinese regulators are tightening supervision of financial holding companies, Ant included. Beijing has kept close watch on the financial instruments that small lenders create out of their consumer loans and sell to investors. Such securities help Ant fund some of its lending. But they also amplify the blowup if too many of those loans arent repaid.Those kinds of derivative products are something the government is really concerned about, said Tian X. Hou, founder of the research firm TH Data Capital. Given Ants size, she said, the government should be concerned.The broader worry for China is about growing levels of household debt. Beijing wants to cultivate a consumer economy, but excessive borrowing could eventually weigh on peoples spending power. The names of two of Alipays popular credit functions, Huabei and Jiebei, are jaunty invitations to spend and borrow.Huang Ling, 22, started using Huabei when she was in high school. At the time, she didnt qualify for a credit card. With Huabeis help, she bought a drone, a scooter, a laptop and more.The credit line made her feel rich. It also made her realize that if she actually wanted to be rich, she had to get busy.Living beyond my means forced me to work harder, Ms. Huang said.First, she opened a clothing shop in her hometown, Nanchang, in southeastern China. Then she started an advertising company in the inland metropolis of Chongqing. When the business needed cash, she borrowed from Jiebei.Online shopping became a way to soothe daily anxieties, and Ms. Huang sometimes racked up thousands of dollars in Huabei bills, which only made her even more anxious. When the pandemic slammed her business, she started falling behind on her payments. That cast her into a deep depression.Finally, early this month, with her parents help, she paid off her debts and closed her Huabei and Jiebei accounts. She felt elated, she said.Chinas recent troubles with freewheeling online loan platforms have put the government under pressure to protect ordinary borrowers.Ant is helped by the fact that its business lines up with many of the Chinese leaderships priorities: encouraging entrepreneurship and financial inclusion, and expanding the middle class. This year, the company helped the eastern city of Hangzhou, where it is based, set up an early version of the governments app-based system for dictating coronavirus quarantines.Such coziness is bound to raise hackles overseas. In Washington, Chinese tech companies that are seen as close to the government are radioactive.In January 2017, Eric Jing, then Ants chief executive, said the company aimed to be serving two billion users worldwide within a decade. Shortly after, Ant announced that it was acquiring the money transfer company MoneyGram to increase its U.S. footprint. By the following January, the deal was dead, thwarted by data security concerns.More recently, top officials in the Trump administration have discussed whether to place Ant Group on the so-called entity list, which prohibits foreign companies from purchasing American products. Officials from the State Department have suggested that an interagency committee, which also includes officials from the departments of defense, commerce and energy, review Ant for the potential entity listing, according to three people familiar with the matter.Ant does not talk much anymore about expanding in the United States.Ana Swanson contributed reporting.","generated_title":"Ant Group's Mega IPO and Its Impact on China's Financial Landscape","publication_date":"2020-10-26","primary_category":"business","content_type":"reporting","keywords":["Ant Group","Alibaba","IPO","financial technology","China","regulators","Jack Ma","Alipay","Yuebao","financial inclusion","household debt","digital currency","consumer loans"],"mentioned_people":["Jack Ma","Fraser Howie","Martin Chorzempa","Tian X.
