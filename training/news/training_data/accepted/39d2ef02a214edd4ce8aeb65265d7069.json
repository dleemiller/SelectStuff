Report Totally Exonerates MeSpeaking to reporters, President Trump answered questions about investigations, North Korea and immigration.Look, if you see what Ive done with North Korea, and with the State Department Mike Pompeo its running so well, I have this running so well. I have purposely, because of this ridiculous witch hunt, I have said, Im going to stay away from the Justice Department until its completed. So I wanted to stay away, now that doesnt mean I have to because I dont have to I can get involved. But I dont want you people to say that Im interfering, that Im doing anything. I think that the report yesterday maybe, more importantly than anything, it totally exonerates me. There was no collusion. There was no obstruction. And if you read the report, youll see that the But sir, the report What would you do with that? Why sir? Excuse me, wait, wait, wait. What youll really see, is youll see bias against me and millions, and tens of millions of my followers, that is really a disgrace. Mr President! And yet, if you, and yet, if you look at the F.B.I. and you went in and you polled the F.B.I. the real F.B.I. those guys love me and I love them. Mr President! Sir! Are you You have spoken so passionately about the circumstances that led to Otto Warmbiers death. In the same breath, youre defending now Kim Jong-uns human rights record. How can you do that? You know why? Because I dont want to see a nuclear weapon destroy you and your family. And, by the way, you declared the nuclear threat from North Korea is over. I dont want to see a nuclear weapon destroy you and your family. I want to have a good relationship with North Korea. I want to have a good relationship with many other countries. And what Ive done if you remember, if youre fair, which most of you arent, but if youre fair, when I came in, people thought we were probably going to war with North Korea. If we did You said the threat is over, is it over? Quiet. Quiet. If we did, millions of people would have been killed. I dont mean like, a you know, people were saying a hundred thousand Seoul has 28 million people, 30 miles off the border. You would have had 30, 40, 50 million people killed. Who knows what would have happened? I came in, that was what I inherited. I should have never inherited that should have been solved long before I got there. I did a great job this weekend. The fake news said, Oh, you met. The only thing they saw that I gave up. One broadcast said, He gave up so much. You know what I gave up? I met. I met, we had great chemistry. He gave us a lot: You havent had a missile test in seven months. You havent had a firing, you havent had a nuclear test in eight and a half months. You havent had missiles flying over Japan. He gave us the remains of our great heroes. I have had so many people begging me, parents and fathers, mothers, daughters, sons, wherever I went, Could you please get the remains of my boy back? Theyre giving them back. Nobody thought that was possible. Sir! Wait. Wait. Excuse me, wait. They are doing so much for us. And now were well on our way to get denuclearization and the agreement says there will be total denuclearization nobody wants to report that. So the only thing I did, was I met, I got along with him great. He is great. We have a great chemistry together. Thats a good thing, not a bad thing. Mr. President, how can Kim love his people if hes killing them? I cant speak to that. I can only speak to the fact that we signed an incredible agreement. Its great. And its going to be great for them, too, because now, North Korea can develop and North Korea can become a great country, economically, it can become whatever they want. But there wont be nuclear weapons and they wont be aimed at you and your family. We now have a very good relationship with North Korea. When I came into this job it looked like war. Not because of me, but because if you remember the sitdown with Barack Obama I think he will admit this, he said the biggest problem that the United States has, and by far the most dangerous problem, and he said to me, that weve ever had, because of nuclear, is North Korea. Now that was shortly before I entered office. I have solved that problem. Now were getting it memorialized and all and that problem is largely solved and part of the reason is we signed number one a very good document. You know what? More importantly than the document, I have a good relationship with Kim Jong-un. Thats a very important thing. I can now, wait, I can now call him. I can now say, Well, we have a problem. I told him, I gave him a very direct number. He can now call me if he has any difficulty. I can call him. We have communications its a very good thing. People are shocked that this is the kind of, you know they thought Trump was going to get in, and he was going to start throwing bombs all over the place. Its actually the opposite. But were building a military so strong $716 billion next year. 700 this year were building a military so strong, nobodys going to mess with us. But you know what, I never want to have to use it. Mr. President, do you agree with children being taken away from their family? No, I hate it. I hate the children being taken away. The Democrats have to change their law. Thats their law. Sir, thats your They were forced Mr President! Mr President! Quiet. Quiet. Thats the Democrats law. We can change it tonight. We can change it right now. Youre the president, you can change it I will leave here. No, no. You need their votes. You need their votes. The Democrats, all they have to do You control both chambers of Congress, the Republicans do. The Democrats, excuse me, by one vote. We dont need it. You need 60 votes. We have a one vote excuse me we need a one vote, We have a one-vote edge, we need 60. So we need 10 votes. We cant get it from the Democrats.Speaking to reporters, President Trump answered questions about investigations, North Korea and immigration.CreditCredit...Evan Vucci/Associated PressJune 15, 2018WASHINGTON He assailed the scum on top of the F.B.I. who were out to get him. He suggested that a former aide did not lie even though he pleaded guilty to lying to investigators. And he distanced himself from his onetime campaign chairman hours before the aide was sent to jail.Reasserting himself on the Washington stage after a week spent overseas or out of sight, President Trump went on offense on Friday in his multifront war with investigators, eagerly framing a new Justice Department report as validation of his claim of a deep state conspiracy against him.They were plotting against my election, Mr. Trump said, pointing to partisan texts sent by several F.B.I. agents during the 2016 presidential campaign and cited in the report. The F.B.I. director at the time, James B. Comey, ran a corrupt operation and should be prosecuted, he added. Comey was the ringleader of this whole, you know, den of thieves.Mr. Trumps rendition of the report by the Justice Department inspector general was selective. The report faulted Peter Strzok, a senior F.B.I. agent, and four other bureau officials for anti-Trump messages, but concluded that no decisions were made out of political bias. Indeed, the reports sharp criticism of Mr. Comey centered on actions that damaged Hillary Clinton during the campaign, not Mr. Trump, and it determined that the decision not to prosecute her for using a private unsecured email server while secretary of state was reasonable.Mr. Trump dismissed that conclusion. The end result was wrong, he said. I mean, there was total bias. I mean, when you look at Peter Strzok and what he said about me. When you look at Comey, all his moves. You know, it was interesting, it was a pretty good report. Then I say that the I.G. blew it at the very end with that statement.The presidents assessment came during a quintessentially Trumpian discourse on current affairs, first on Fox & Friends and then with reporters who surrounded him on the White House driveway. Seemingly energized by his landmark meeting this week with North Koreas leader, Kim Jong-un, Mr. Trump depicted his presidency as a string of unvarnished successes despite the unfair and even criminal forces arrayed against him.Even aside from Mr. Comey and the total thieves at the F.B.I., Mr. Trump mounted withering attacks on a variety of other favorite targets, including congressional Democrats, Barack Obama, Robert S. Mueller III, Canadas prime minister, professional football players and the news media. At the same time, he extolled his warm relations with leaders of North Korea, China and Russia.Weve done more I dont say this in a bragging way, actually some of the haters actually say this weve done more in 500 days, so now its 510 days, than any 500-day president, first term, by far, he said at one point. And thats what I want to do, I want to really you know, I got elected to make America great again, very simple.Indeed, in case the message did not get through, Mr. Trump used the words great or greatest 48 times. He dismissed contrary information and blamed any setbacks on Mr. Obama or the Democratic minorities in Congress. When its my fault, he said, Ill tell you.As he often does, Mr. Trump misstated or distorted a variety of facts, large and small, over the course of the television appearance and subsequent conversation with reporters.On vindication from the inspector general: If you read the I.G. report, Ive been totally exonerated. (Not true. The report examined the investigation into Mrs. Clintons email server and had nothing to say about Mr. Trumps actions one way or the other.)On bias in the special counsels office: They have no Republicans. (Not true. Mr. Mueller, the special counsel, is a lifelong Republican.)On distancing himself from Paul Manafort, his indicted former campaign chairman, who was sent to jail on Friday: He worked for me, what, for 49 days or something? (Not true. Actually, it was 144 days.)He likewise made expansive claims. He suggested that the vague 391-word statement he signed with Mr. Kim during their meeting in Singapore ended the nuclear standoff with North Korea. I signed an agreement where we get everything, everything, he said.ImageCredit...Evan Vucci/Associated PressAlthough there is no concrete arrangement for how North Korea would dismantle its nuclear weapons arsenal, when it would happen or who would verify that it happened, Mr. Trump dismissed such questions as minor details that will be worked out.I have solved that problem, he told reporters. Now, were getting it memorialized and all. But that problem is largely solved.He praised Mr. Kim, brushing aside questions about the repressive government and gulags in North Korea. He speaks and his people sit up at attention. I want my people to do the same, he joked.Mr. Trump confirmed that he wants to meet President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia this summer, brushing off Moscows annexation of Crimea in 2014, which he blamed on Mr. Obama rather than Mr. Putin. President Obama lost Crimea because President Putin didnt respect President Obama, he said.Likewise, he faulted Democrats in Congress for the federal authorities separating children from parents trying to cross the border from Mexico under a zero tolerance policy announced by Attorney General Jeff Sessions.I hate the children being taken away, he said. The Democrats have to change their law. Thats their law.While both houses of Congress are run by Republicans, Mr. Trump said they could not act because it would require Democratic votes in the Senate to overcome a filibuster. Democrats, however, said they would hardly filibuster legislation barring the separation of families at the border because they have already introduced such a bill with more than 30 Democratic sponsors.Mr. Trump signaled qualified support for Scott Pruitt, his administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, who is facing at least a dozen investigations into his spending and use of his office for personal matters.Im not happy about certain things, Ill be honest, Mr. Trump said. Im not happy about certain things, but hes done a fantastic job running the E.P.A., which is very overriding.Mr. Trump also returned to other frequent topics. He mocked National Football League players for protesting racism when they are making $15 million a year. He again assailed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada for saying he would not be pushed around over tariffs.And he dismissed the importance of a misleading statement he dictated last year about a Trump Tower meeting with Russians during the 2016 campaign, a statement that his lawyer and spokeswoman at first denied he had dictated even though his legal team later admitted that he had. Its irrelevant, Mr. Trump said. Thats not a statement to a high tribunal of judges. Thats a statement to the phony New York Times.Mr. Trump even suggested that his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, a retired three-star general, did not actually lie to investigators even though he has pleaded guilty to doing so and the president himself has previously said he fired Mr. Flynn for lying.I feel badly for General Flynn, he said. Hes lost his house, hes lost his life. And some people say he lied and some people say he didnt lie. I mean really it turned out maybe he didnt lie. How can you do that? How can you do that because whos lied more than Comey? Comey lied a tremendous amount.The president seemed most animated, however, by the new inspector general report and used it to undercut Mr. Comey and Mr. Mueller. What he did was criminal, Mr. Trump said of Mr. Comey. What he did was a terrible thing to the people. What he did was so bad in terms of our Constitution, in terms of the well-being of our country. What he did was horrible.Mr. Trump continued, Should he be locked up? Let somebody make a determination.Mr. Strzok worked on the investigation into Mrs. Clinton in 2016 and his texts to a colleague, Lisa Page, were cited by the inspector general for showing an unprofessional bias. When Ms. Page was alarmed in August 2016 at the prospect of Mr. Trumps winning the election, Mr. Strzok reassured her. Well stop it, he wrote.Mr. Trump said that proved the F.B.I. was trying to sabotage him. Peter Strzok should have been fired a long time ago and others should have been fired, he said.",
