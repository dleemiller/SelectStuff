Icahn, unhappy with Pep Boys decision to sell itself to Bridgestone, the tire company, is fighting back with his own takeover offer.Mr. Icahn, the billionaire investor, disclosed on Monday that he had offered to buy Pep Boys, the car parts retailer, for $15.50 a share in cash, topping the $15 a share Bridgestone had bid.Mr. Icahns offer casts some doubt on the deal by Pep Boys, formally known as Pep Boys Manny Moe & Jack, to sell itself to Bridgestone, announced in late October. That proposed transaction would have added about 800 stores to the Bridgestone network of 2,200 tire and car service centers.That takeover had lifted the spirits of Pep Boyss shareholders, many of whom had become frustrated with roughly flat revenue in the last four years. The money manager Mario Gabelli had threatened to wage a fight over the companys board before settling in June.ImageCredit...Fred R. Conrad/The New York TimesYet even the Bridgestone offer, which represented a premium of nearly 24 percent to the companys previous closing price, apparently has failed to win over major investors, including Mr. Icahn.In a letter to Pep Boys, an executive at his investment vehicle argued that Mondays offer was clearly superior and was not contingent on due diligence or financing.Mr. Icahn disclosed on Friday that he owned about 12 percent of the retailer, making him the second-largest shareholder behind Mr. Gabellis firm.In a news release issued before Mr. Icahns latest disclosure, Pep Boys said that he had previously refused to raise his own takeover bid for the company above $13.50 a share, and until that point had not presented any alternative offer.Shares of Pep Boys were up 2.5 percent in midafternoon trading on Monday, after Mr. Icahn disclosed his offer.","generated_title":"Carl Icahn Makes Counterbid for Pep Boys","publication_date":"2015-12-07","primary_category":"business","content_type":"reporting","keywords":["Carl Icahn","Pep Boys","Bridgestone","takeover bid","car parts retailer","shareholders","investment","Mario Gabelli"],"mentioned_people":["Carl Icahn","Mario Gabelli"],"mentioned_organizations":["Pep Boys","Bridgestone"],"mentioned_legislation":null,"mentioned_locations":null,"sentiment_tone":"neutral","extracted_quotes":["Mr. Icahn, the billionaire investor, disclosed on Monday that he had offered to buy Pep Boys, the car parts retailer, for $15.50 a share in cash, topping the $15 a share Bridgestone had bid.","In a letter to Pep Boys, an executive at his investment vehicle argued that Mondays offer was clearly superior and was not contingent on due diligence or financing."]}
